Existing works mainly focus on recommending a set of items, but online e-commerce platforms have recently begun to pay attention to exploring users' potential interests at the category level. Category-level recommendation allows e-commerce platforms to promote users' engagements by expanding their interests to different types of items. In addition, it complements item-level recommendations when the latter becomes extremely challenging for users with little-known information and past interactions. Furthermore, it facilitates item-level recommendations in existing works. The predicted category, which is called intention in those works, aids the exploration of item-level preference. However, such category-level preference prediction has mostly been accomplished through applying item-level models. Some key differences between item-level recommendations and category-level recommendations are ignored in such a simplistic adaptation. In this paper, we propose a cascading category recommender (CCRec) model with a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode item-level information to perform category-level recommendations. Experiments show the advantages of this model over methods designed for item-level recommendations."}

Recognizing the computational cost of advancing neural rerankers, we analyze techniques for enhancing efficiency, notably knowledge distillation for creating competitive, lighter alternatives. Furthermore, we map the emerging territory of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in reranking, examining novel prompting strategies and fine-tuning tactics.

While behavioral fingerprinting based on network traffic analysis has shown promise, most existing approaches rely on machine learning (ML) techniques applied to fine-grained features of short-lived traffic units (packets and/or flows). These methods tend to be computationally expensive, sensitive to traffic measurement errors, and often produce opaque inferences. In this paper, we propose a macroscopic, lightweight, and explainable alternative to behavioral fingerprinting focusing on the network services (e.g., TCP/80, UDP/53) that IoT devices use to perform their intended functions over extended periods. Our contributions are threefold. (1) We demonstrate that IoT devices exhibit stable and distinguishable patterns in their use of network services over a period of time. We formalize the notion of service-level fingerprints and derive a generalized method to represent network behaviors using a configurable granularity parameter. (2) We develop a procedure to extract service-level fingerprints, apply it to traffic from 13 consumer IoT device types in a lab testbed, and evaluate the resulting representations in terms of their convergence and recurrence properties. (3) We validate the efficacy of service-level fingerprints for device identification in closed-set and open-set scenarios. Our findings are based on a large dataset comprising about 10 million IPFIX flow records collected over a 1.5-year period."}

We evaluated 13 experiments spanning fundamental optics (Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, Michelson/Mach-Zehnder interferometry, Bell states, delayed-choice quantum eraser), quantum information protocols (BB84 QKD, Franson interferometry, GHZ states, quantum teleportation, hyperentanglement), and advanced technologies (boson sampling, electromagnetically induced transparency, frequency conversion). The system achieves design-simulation alignment scores of 8--9/10, with simulations faithfully modeling intended physics. A critical finding distinguishes structural correctness from quantitative accuracy: high alignment confirms correct physics architecture, while numerical predictions require expert review.

Existing methods typically construct sparser views by randomly perturbing the original interaction graph, as they have no idea about the authentic user preferences. Owing to the sparse nature of recommendation data, this paradigm can only capture insufficient semantic information. To address the issue, we propose InfoDCL, a novel diffusion-based contrastive learning framework for recommendation. Rather than injecting randomly sampled Gaussian noise, we employ a single-step diffusion process that integrates noise with auxiliary semantic information to generate signals and feed them to the standard diffusion process to generate authentic user preferences as contrastive views. Besides, based on a comprehensive analysis of the mutual influence between generation and preference learning in InfoDCL, we build a collaborative training objective strategy to transform the interference between them into mutual collaboration. Additionally, we employ multiple GCN layers only during inference stage to incorporate higher-order co-occurrence information while maintaining training efficiency. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that InfoDCL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our InfoDCL offers an effective solution for enhancing recommendation performance and suggests a novel paradigm for applying diffusion method in contrastive learning frameworks."}

This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a novel framework that models how ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state. The framework reveals that moral duty is not lost to uncertainty but transforms: as uncertainty increases, Action Duty (the duty to act decisively) is proportionally converted into Repair Duty (the active duty to verify, inquire, and resolve uncertainty).\n  This dynamic is expressed by the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], where Total Duty is a function of Knowledge (K), Humility/Uncertainty (HI), and Contextual Signal Strength (C_signal). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda > 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making.\n  By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity. The findings suggest that proportional duty serves as a stabilizing principle within complex systems, preventing both overreach and omission by dynamically balancing epistemic confidence against contextual risk."}

However, recent studies highlight the importance of high-frequency signals. The role of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals in recommendation remains unclear. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the influence of graph signals on recommendation performance. We theoretically prove that the effects of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals are equivalent in recommendation tasks, as both contribute by smoothing the similarities between user-item pairs. To leverage this insight, we propose a frequency signal scaler, a plug-and-play module that adjusts the graph signal filter function to fine-tune the smoothness between user-item pairs, making it compatible with any GNN model. Additionally, we identify and prove that graph embedding-based methods cannot fully capture the characteristics of graph signals. To address this limitation, a space flip method is introduced to restore the expressive power of graph embeddings. Remarkably, we demonstrate that either low-frequency or high-frequency graph signals alone are sufficient for effective recommendations.

Although such personalization through memory offers clear benefits, it also introduces risks of bias.

Using recruitment as an example use case, we simulate the behavior of a memory-enhanced personalized agent, and study whether and how bias is introduced and amplified in and across various stages of operation.

The approach mirrors the way in which epidemiologists enable public health interventions through statistical evidence before molecular mechanisms are understood. This bypasses the problem of model complexity which plagues current interpretability methods (such as SHAP and mechanistic interpretability) at the scale of deployed models.\n  AI Epidemiology achieves this population-level surveillance by standardising capture of AI-expert interactions into structured assessment fields: risk level, alignment score, and accuracy score. These function as exposure variables which predict output failure through statistical associations, much like cholesterol and blood pressure act as exposure variables predicting cardiac events. Output-failure associations are subsequently validated against expert overrides and real-world outcomes.\n  The framework places zero burden on experts and provides automatic audit trails by passively tracking expert convergence and divergence with AI recommendations. Since it analyses outputs rather than internal model computations, it also provides governance continuity when institutions update models and switch vendors. Finally, by providing reliability scores and semantic assessments (e.g. 'this recommendation resembles 500 cases overridden by experts due to guideline violations'), it enables experts and institutions to detect unreliable AI outputs before they cause harm.

MOBIMEM first introduces three specialized memory primitives to decouple agent evolution from model weights: (1) Profile Memory uses a lightweight distance-graph (DisGraph) structure to align with user preferences, resolving the accuracy-latency trade-off in user profile retrieval; (2) Experience Memory employs multi-level templates to instantiate execution logic for new tasks, ensuring capability generalization; and (3) Action Memory records fine-grained interaction sequences, reducing the reliance on expensive model inference. Building upon this memory architecture, MOBIMEM further integrates a suite of OS-inspired services to orchestrate execution: a scheduler that coordinates parallel sub-task execution and memory operations; an agent record-and-replay (AgentRR) mechanism that enables safe and efficient action reuse; and a context-aware exception handling that ensures graceful recovery from user interruptions and runtime errors.\n  Evaluation on AndroidWorld and top-50 apps shows that MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices."}

It achieves a forward prediction accuracy $R^2=0.98$ (2\\% relative error) and sub-5\\% pixelwise reconstruction error. Inverse solutions satisfy target properties to within $1\\%$ relative error. Inverting a sweep through properties reveal smooth traversal of the latent manifold, and UMAP visualization confirms the emergence of a low-dimensional, disentangled manifold. By unifying prediction and generation within a single latent space, Janus enables real-time, physics-informed inverse microstructure generation at a lower computational cost typically associated with classical optimization-based approaches."}

Effective CE triage requires adaptive decisions that balance retained value against the costs and constraints of processing and labour. This paper presents a novel decision-making framework as a simple deterministic solver over a state-augmented Disassembly Sequencing Planning (DSP) graph. By encoding the disassembly history into the state, our framework enforces the Markov property, enabling optimal, recursive evaluation by ensuring each decision only depends on the previous state. The triage decision involves choices between continuing disassembly or committing to a CE option. The model integrates condition-aware utility based on diagnostic health scores and complex operational constraints. We demonstrate the framework's flexibility with a worked example: the hierarchical triage of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, where decisions are driven by the recursive valuation of components. The example illustrates how a unified formalism enables the accommodation of varying mechanical complexity, safety requirements, and economic drivers. This unified formalism therefore provides a tractable and generalisable foundation for optimising CE triage decisions across diverse products and operational contexts."}

Multimodal models such as CLIP have been able to perform well on this task by learning semantic similarities across vision and language; however, despite these advances, image classification is still a challenging task. Models with low capacity often suffer from underfitting and thus underperform on fine-grained image classification. Along with this, it is important to ensure high-quality data with rich cross-modal representations of each class, which is often difficult to generate. When datasets do not enforce balanced demographics, the predictions will be biased toward the more represented class, while others will be neglected. We focus on how these issues can lead to harmful bias for zero-shot image classification, and explore how to combat these issues in demographic bias. We propose Diverse Demographic Data Generation (D3G), a training-free, zero-shot method of boosting classification accuracy while reducing demographic bias in pre-trained multimodal models. With this method, we utilize CLIP as our base multimodal model and Stable Diffusion XL as our generative model. We demonstrate that providing diverse demographic data at inference time improves performance for these models, and explore the impact of individual demographics on the resulting accuracy metric."}

Training a machine-learned model for VSR typically requires vast amounts of annotated images. Yet, species-level annotation demands domain expertise, making it realistic for domain experts to annotate only a few examples. These limited labeled data motivate training an ''expert'' model via few-shot learning (FSL). Meanwhile, advanced Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated prominent performance on general recognition tasks. It is straightforward to ask whether LMMs excel in the highly specialized VSR task and whether they outshine FSL expert models. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that LMMs struggle in this task, despite using various established prompting techniques. LMMs even significantly underperform FSL expert models, which are as simple as finetuning a pretrained visual encoder on the few-shot images. However, our in-depth analysis reveals that LMMs can effectively post-hoc correct the expert models' incorrect predictions. Briefly, given a test image, when prompted with the top predictions from an FSL expert model, LMMs can recover the ground-truth label. Building on this insight, we derive a simple method called Post-hoc Correction (POC), which prompts an LMM to re-rank the expert model's top predictions using enriched prompts that include softmax confidence scores and few-shot visual examples. Across five challenging VSR benchmarks, POC outperforms prior art of FSL by +6.4% in accuracy without extra training, validation, or manual intervention. Importantly, POC generalizes to different pretrained backbones and LMMs, serving as a plug-and-play module to significantly enhance existing FSL methods."}

Darth Vecdor (DV) was designed to extract this knowledge into a structured, terminology-mapped, SQL database (\"knowledge base\" or \"knowledge graph\").

Although one might query an LLM directly rather than a SQL-based knowledge graph, concerns such as cost, speed, safety, and confidence may arise, especially in high-volume operations. These may be mitigated when the information is pre-extracted from the LLM and becomes query-able through a standard database. However, the author found the need to address several issues. These included erroneous, off-topic, free-text, overly general, and inconsistent LLM responses, as well as allowing for multi-element responses. DV was built with features intended to mitigate these issues. To facilitate ease of use, and to allow for prompt engineering by those with domain expertise but little technical background, DV provides a simple, browser-based graphical user interface.

The machine learning literature provides ample analysis with respect to the mechanisms to which linearity is induced. However, the analysis of extrapolation at the origin under the NTK regime remains a more unexplored special case. In particular, the infinite-dimensional feature map induced by the neural tangent kernel is not translationally invariant. This means that the study of an out-of-distribution evaluation point very far from the origin is not equivalent to the evaluation of a point very near the origin. And since the feature map is rotation invariant, these two special cases may represent the most canonically extreme bounds of ReLU NTK extrapolation. Ultimately, it is this loose recognition of the two special cases of extrapolation that motivate the discovery of quadratic extrapolation for an evaluation close to the origin."}

Most of the standard RAG frameworks regard all retrieved information as equally reliable, overlooking the varying credibility and interconnected nature of large textual corpora. GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus, which requires either pre-existing knowledge graphs that are expensive to build and update, or automated graph construction pipelines that are often unreliable. Moreover, systems following this paradigm typically use large language models to guide graph traversal and evidence retrieval, leading to challenges similar to those encountered with standard RAG. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG framework that employs the spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from a corpus of documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of large language models on complex tasks such as multi-hop question answering. Experiments show that our method achieves better or comparable performance to iterative RAG methodologies, while also being easily integrable as a plug-and-play module with a wide range of RAG-based approaches. Combining our method with chain-of-thought iterative retrieval yields up to a 39\\% absolute gain in answer correctness compared to naive RAG, achieving these results with small open-weight language models and highlighting its effectiveness in resource-constrained settings."}

To address this limitation, we propose GLOW, a unified framework for AW performance prediction that combines the graph-structure modeling capabilities of GNNs with the reasoning power of LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a graph-oriented LLM, instruction-tuned on graph tasks, to extract topologically aware semantic features, which are fused with GNN-encoded structural representations. A contrastive alignment strategy further refines the latent space to distinguish high-quality AWs.

In this work, we investigate the feasibility of replacing LLM-driven workflows with optimized SLMs. We trained a domain-adapted SLM to execute representative tasks traditionally handled by LLMs, such as document summarization, query answering, and structured data interpretation. As part of the experiment, we investigated the fine-tuning of facebook/opt-350m model (single epoch only) using the Hugging Face TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning), specifically the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trainer. The OPT-350M model was released by Meta AI in 2022 as part of the OPT (Open Pretrained Transformer) family of models. Similar studies demonstrate that even models at the 350M parameter scale can meaningfully contribute to instruction-tuning pipelines (Mekala et al., 2024).

One of the critical challenges is the continuous emergence of new applications, which generates Out-of-Distribution (OOD) traffic patterns that deviate from known categories and are not well represented by predefined models.

Although some methods mitigate this limitation by simply classifying unknown traffic into a single \"Other\" category, they fail to make a fine-grained classification. In this paper, we propose a Two-stage Adaptive OOD classification Network (TAO-Net) that achieves accurate classification for both In-Distribution (ID) and OOD encrypted traffic. The method incorporates an innovative two-stage design: the first stage employs a hybrid OOD detection mechanism that integrates transformer-based inter-layer transformation smoothness and feature analysis to effectively distinguish between ID and OOD traffic, while the second stage leverages large language models with a novel semantic-enhanced prompt strategy to transform OOD traffic classification into a generation task, enabling flexible fine-grained classification without relying on predefined labels. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TAO-Net achieves 96.81-97.70% macro-precision and 96.77-97.68% macro-F1, outperforming previous methods that only reach 44.73-86.30% macro-precision, particularly in identifying emerging network applications."}

We address this gap by repositioning the LLM as an intelligent judge that evaluates, explains, and strategically coordinates an ensemble of foundation models. To overcome the LLM's inherent lack of domain-specific knowledge on time series, we introduce an R1-style finetuning process, guided by SHAP-based faithfulness scores, which teaches the model to interpret ensemble weights as meaningful causal statements about temporal dynamics. The trained agent then engages in iterative, multi-turn conversations to perform forward-looking assessments, provide causally-grounded explanations for its weighting decisions, and adaptively refine the optimization strategy.

Our analysis shows constraints reduce effective data heterogeneity by 41% and improve privacy-utility tradeoffs through hypothesis space reduction by factor theta=0.37. Under (epsilon,delta)-differential privacy with epsilon=10, constraint regularization maintains utility within 3.7% of non-private baseline versus 12.1% degradation for standard federated learning, representing 2.7x improvement. We validate our framework on manufacturing predictive maintenance using Bosch production data with 1.18 million samples and 968 sensor features, constructing knowledge graphs encoding 3,000 constraints from ISA-95 and MASON ontologies. Experiments demonstrate 22% faster convergence, 41.3% model divergence reduction, and constraint violation thresholds where rho<0.05 maintains 90% optimal performance while rho>0.18 causes catastrophic failure. Our theoretical predictions match empirical observations with R^2>0.90 across convergence, privacy, and violation-performance relationships."}

The approach combines classical dimensional analysis with modern machine learning techniques. Starting from measurements of physical quantities, the method identifies the fundamental ways to combine variables into dimensionless groups, then uses neural networks to discover which combinations best predict the experimental output. A key innovation is a regularization technique that encourages the learned coefficients to take simple, interpretable values like integers or half-integers, making the discovered laws both accurate and physically meaningful. We systematically investigate how measurement noise and discrete sampling affect the discovery process, demonstrating that the regularization approach provides robustness to experimental uncertainties. The method successfully handles cases with single or multiple dimensionless numbers, revealing how different but equivalent representations can capture the same underlying physics. Despite recent progress, key challenges remain, including managing the computational cost of identifying multiple dimensionless groups, understanding the influence of data characteristics, automating the selection of relevant input variables, and developing user-friendly tools for experimentalists.

This limitation reflects an incomplete understanding of how specific flow features contribute to thrombus initiation and growth. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework for spatial thrombosis assessment based directly on computational fluid dynamics-derived flow features. A logistic regression (LR) model combined with a structured feature-selection pipeline is used to derive a compact and physically interpretable feature set, including nonlinear feature combinations. The framework is trained using spatial risk patterns from a validated, macro-scale thrombosis model for two representative scenarios. The model reproduces the labeled risk distributions and identifies distinct sets of flow features associated with increased thrombosis risk. When applied to a centrifugal pump, despite training on a single axial pump operating point, the model predicts plausible thrombosis-prone regions. These results show that interpretable machine learning can link local flow features to thrombosis risk while remaining computationally efficient and mechanistically transparent. The low computational cost enables rapid thrombogenicity screening without repeated or costly simulations. The proposed framework complements physics-based thrombosis modeling and provides a methodological basis for integrating interpretable machine learning into CFD-driven thrombosis analysis and device design workflows."}

Specifically, we first construct a cross-sample bank by segmenting historical data into hypotensive and non-hypotensive samples. Then, we introduce a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy for building test-time training data: we initially apply K-Shape clustering to identify representative cluster centers and subsequently retrieve the top-K semantically similar samples based on the current patient signal. Additionally, we integrate both self-supervised masked reconstruction and retrospective sequence forecasting signals during training to enhance model adaptability to rapid and subtle intraoperative dynamics. We evaluate the proposed CSA-TTA on both the VitalDB dataset and a real-world in-hospital dataset by integrating it with state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, including TimesFM and UniTS. CSA-TTA consistently enhances performance across settings-for instance, on VitalDB, it improves Recall and F1 scores by +1.33% and +1.13%, respectively, under fine-tuning, and by +7.46% and +5.07% in zero-shot scenarios-demonstrating strong robustness and generalization."}

However, these methods restrict the training to a limited subspace, which can sometimes reduce performance.\n  For Small Language Models (SLMs), where efficiency gains matter even more, we introduce AdaGradSelect, an adaptive method that selects which transformer blocks to update based on gradients.\n  Early observations showed that updating only the transformer blocks with the highest gradient norms can achieve performance close to full fine-tuning. Building on this insight, AdaGradSelect adaptively chooses which blocks to train. It uses a combination of Dirichlet-based sampling, which depends on how frequently blocks were updated in the past, and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. This lets the method explore different blocks in early training and gradually focus on the most important ones in later epochs.\n  Experiments show that AdaGradSelect trains about 12 percent faster and uses 35 percent less GPU memory while delivering performance very close to full fine-tuning. On the GSM8K dataset, it outperforms LoRA (rank 256) by about 3 percent on average across models such as Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA3.2-1B, and Phi4-mini-3.8B.

We introduce SPRITE, a novel framework that overcomes this dilemma by leveraging simulators and large models to programmatically synthesize scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data. The core innovation of SPRITE is to reframe ground-truth generation as a code-generation task. We utilize LLMs to compile complex spatial questions into executable programs, which are then verified against high-precision scene meta-information extracted from simulators. This ensures our ground truth is both computationally precise and verifiable, while the generative power of LLMs provides vast linguistic diversity. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated a dataset encompassing 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs. We demonstrate that a VLM trained on our data achieves significant performance gains on multiple spatial benchmarks and outperforms other open-source datasets of equivalent size. Furthermore, a scalability analysis confirms our hypothesis that overcoming the low-diversity nature of traditional template methods is essential for building robust, generalizable spatial intelligence. We will make the SPRITE framework code and the full 300k+ dataset publicly available to facilitate future research in spatial intelligence."}

While some training data is publicly available, substantial investment is required to generate proprietary datasets, such as human preference annotations or to curate new ones from existing sources. As larger datasets generally yield better model performance, two natural questions arise. First, how can data owners make informed decisions about curation strategies and data sources investment? Second, how can multiple data owners collaboratively pool their resources to train superior models while fairly distributing the benefits? This problem, data valuation, which is not specific to large language models, has been addressed by the machine learning community through the lens of cooperative game theory, with the Shapley value being the prevalent solution concept. However, computing Shapley values is notoriously expensive for data valuation, typically requiring numerous model retrainings, which can become prohibitive for large machine learning models. In this work, we demonstrate that this computational challenge is dramatically simplified for LLMs trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We show how the specific mathematical structure of DPO enables scalable Shapley value computation.

Yet standard schemes (linear weight soups, task vectors, and Fisher-weighted averaging) can preserve loss while quietly destroying alignment. We argue that merging is not a numerical trick but a geometry-constrained operation around an already-aligned anchor: fusion must be steered to respect safety geometry, not validated post hoc.\n  We introduce AlignMerge, a geometry-aware merging framework that makes alignment an explicit invariant. In a local Fisher chart around an instruction-tuned base, we estimate an alignment subspace with projector P_A and optimize:\n  L_AlignMerge = L_geo + lambda_align * L_align + lambda_bud * L_bud,\n  where L_geo keeps the merge close to its experts in Fisher-Rao geometry, L_align penalizes motion along alignment-sensitive directions, and L_bud enforces a soft alignment budget. As the alignment functional we use the decoding-invariant Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a latent-space criterion that captures how cleanly aligned and misaligned behaviors separate in representation space.\n  Across five model families (LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2, Phi-3.5, Gemma 2), merging safety anchors with task experts, AlignMerge improves alignment metrics (AQI, toxicity, LLM-judge alignment) while matching or exceeding the best expert on instruction-following, reasoning, and helpfulness.

However, these models often exhibit discrepancies from the reality due to unmodeled effects or simplifying assumptions. We refer to this gap as the ignorance model. While purely data-driven approaches attempt to learn full system behavior, they require large amounts of high-quality data across the entire spatial and temporal domain. In real-world scenarios, such information is unavailable, making full data-driven modeling unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we model of the ignorance component using a hybrid twin approach, instead of simulating phenomena from scratch. Since physics-based models approximate the overall behavior of the phenomena, the remaining ignorance is typically lower in complexity than the full physical response, therefore, it can be learned with significantly fewer data. A key difficulty, however, is that spatial measurements are sparse, also obtaining data measuring the same phenomenon for different spatial configurations is challenging in practice. Our contribution is to overcome this limitation by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the ignorance model. GNNs learn the spatial pattern of the missing physics even when the number of measurement locations is limited. This allows us to enrich the physics-based model with data-driven corrections without requiring dense spatial, temporal and parametric data. To showcase the performance of the proposed method, we evaluate this GNN-based hybrid twin on nonlinear heat transfer problems across different meshes, geometries, and load positions. Results show that the GNN successfully captures the ignorance and generalizes corrections across spatial configurations, improving simulation accuracy and interpretability, while minimizing data requirements."}

However, it is non-trivial to address the following challenges: how to match the base model's denoising quality at lower cost under time-varying task difficulty in embodied settings, and how to dynamically and interactively adjust computation based on task difficulty in such environments. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Reinforcement-based Speculative Diffusion Policy (TS-DP), the first framework that enables speculative decoding for DP with temporal adaptivity. First, to handle dynamic environments where task difficulty varies over time, we distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model and replace its costly denoising calls. Second, an RL-based scheduler further adapts to time-varying task difficulty by adjusting speculative parameters to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency.

However, the Gaussian kernel's lack of data-dependence and computational overhead limit its scalability and effectiveness for categorical biological sequences. Recent work proposed the isolation kernel as an alternative, yet it may not optimally capture sequence similarities. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate nine different kernel functions for t-SNE applied to molecular sequences, using three embedding methods: One-Hot Encoding, Spike2Vec, and minimizers. Through both subjective visualization and objective metrics (including neighborhood preservation scores), we demonstrate that the cosine similarity kernel in general outperforms other kernels, including Gaussian and isolation kernels, achieving superior runtime efficiency and better preservation of pairwise distances in low-dimensional space. We further validate our findings through extensive classification and clustering experiments across six diverse biological datasets (Spike7k, Host, ShortRead, Rabies, Genome, and Breast Cancer), employing multiple machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics. Our results show that kernel selection significantly impacts not only visualization quality but also downstream analytical tasks, with the cosine similarity kernel providing the most robust performance across different data types and embedding strategies, making it particularly suitable for large-scale biological sequence analysis."}

Although naturally complementary, these two information streams are highly heterogeneous in both paradigm and reasoning, making it difficult for existing methods to unify them or effectively model their cross-level interactions. To address this gap, we propose ForenAgent, a multi-round interactive IFD framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and iteratively refine Python-based low-level tools around the detection objective, thereby achieving more flexible and interpretable forgery analysis. ForenAgent follows a two-stage training pipeline combining Cold Start and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning to enhance its tool interaction capability and reasoning adaptability progressively. Inspired by human reasoning, we design a dynamic reasoning loop comprising global perception, local focusing, iterative probing, and holistic adjudication, and instantiate it as both a data-sampling strategy and a task-aligned process reward. For systematic training and evaluation, we construct FABench, a heterogeneous, high-quality agent-forensics dataset comprising 100k images and approximately 200k agent-interaction question-answer pairs. Experiments show that ForenAgent exhibits emergent tool-use competence and reflective reasoning on challenging IFD tasks when assisted by low-level tools, charting a promising route toward general-purpose IFD.

The contributions collected here span applications from automated equation discovery and emergent-phenomena modelling to the construction of compact emulators for computationally expensive simulations.\n  The introductory review outlines the conceptual foundations of SR, contrasts it with conventional regression approaches, and surveys its main use cases in the physical sciences, including the derivation of effective theories, empirical functional forms and surrogate models. We summarise methodological considerations such as search-space design, operator selection, complexity control, feature selection, and integration with modern AI approaches. We also highlight ongoing challenges, including scalability, robustness to noise, overfitting and computational complexity.

Despite their shared goal, these models have disparate algorithms, theoretical structures, and tradeoffs: discrete diffusion has the most natural domain, Gaussian diffusion has more mature algorithms, and diffusion on the simplex in principle combines the strengths of the other two but in practice suffers from a numerically unstable stochastic processes. Ideally we could see each of these models as instances of the same underlying framework, and enable practitioners to switch between models for downstream applications. However previous theories have only considered connections in special cases. Here we build a theory unifying all three methods of discrete diffusion as different parameterizations of the same underlying process: the Wright-Fisher population genetics model. In particular, we find simplicial and Gaussian diffusion as two large-population limits. Our theory formally connects the likelihoods and hyperparameters of these models and leverages decades of mathematical genetics literature to unlock stable simplicial diffusion. Finally, we relieve the practitioner of balancing model trade-offs by demonstrating it is possible to train a single model that can perform diffusion in any of these three domains at test time. Our experiments show that Wright-Fisher simplicial diffusion is more stable and outperforms previous simplicial diffusion models on conditional DNA generation. We also show that we can train models on multiple domains at once that are competitive with models trained on any individual domain."}

Proof of Quality (PoQ) replaces cryptographic verification of computation with consensus over output quality, but the original formulation ignores heterogeneous computational costs across inference and evaluator nodes. This paper introduces a cost-aware PoQ framework that integrates explicit efficiency measurements into the reward mechanism for both types of nodes. The design combines ground truth token level F1, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT based judgments within a unified evaluation pipeline, and adopts a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost.\n  Experiments on extractive question answering and abstractive summarization use five instruction tuned LLMs ranging from TinyLlama-1.1B to Llama-3.2-3B and three evaluation models spanning cross encoder and bi encoder architectures. Results show that a semantic textual similarity bi encoder achieves much higher correlation with both ground truth and GPT scores than cross encoders, indicating that evaluator architecture is a critical design choice for PoQ. Quality-cost analysis further reveals that the largest models in the pool are also the most efficient in terms of quality per unit latency. Monte Carlo simulations over 5\\,000 PoQ rounds demonstrate that the cost-aware reward scheme consistently assigns higher average rewards to high quality low cost inference models and to efficient evaluators, while penalizing slow low quality nodes. These findings suggest that cost-aware PoQ provides a practical foundation for economically sustainable decentralized LLM inference."}

Yet, VLM decisions are influenced by the perceived demographic attributes of people in the input, which can lead to biased outcomes like failing to identify women as doctors. Moreover, when reducing bias leads to performance loss, users may have varying needs for balancing bias mitigation with overall model capabilities, highlighting the demand for methods that enable controllable bias reduction during inference. Activation steering is a popular approach for inference-time controllability that has shown potential in inducing safer behavior in large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that current steering methods struggle to correct biases, where equiprobable outcomes across demographic groups are required. To address this, we propose Direct Steering Optimization (DSO) which uses reinforcement learning to find linear transformations for steering activations, tailored to mitigate bias while maintaining control over model performance. We demonstrate that DSO achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between fairness and capabilities on both VLMs and LLMs, while offering practitioners inference-time control over the trade-off. Overall, our work highlights the benefit of designing steering strategies that are directly optimized to control model behavior, providing more effective bias intervention than methods that rely on pre-defined heuristics for controllability."}

We argue that while current AI may influence physics, physics has significantly more to offer this generation of AI. Current architectures - large language models, reasoning models, and agentic AI - can depend on trillions of meaningless parameters, suffer from distributional bias, lack uncertainty quantification, provide no mechanistic insights, and fail to capture even elementary scientific laws.

We employ a pretrain and fine-tune paradigm, which utilizes partially labelled data and we demonstrate this is substantially more effective than traditional fully-supervised methods in this data-sparse environment. During fine-tuning, we systematically integrate and evaluate a suite of enhancements--including hierarchical label smoothing, a weighted loss function, and a multi-head output layer from MycoAI--to specifically tackle the challenges of fungal taxonomy. Our experiments show that each of these components yields significant performance gains. On a challenging fungal classification benchmark with distinct taxonomic distribution shifts from the broad training set, our final model outperforms a range of existing methods across all taxonomic levels.

At the single-kernel level, we attain performance close to the architectural peak. At the graph and system levels, we provide a structured parallelization method that can scale across the 2D AIE-ML fabric and exploit its dedicated memory tiles to stay entirely on-chip throughout the model execution.

In this paper, we address the case when it is not possible to tag known locations and show that it is possible to localize tags to accuracies comparable to global positioning systems (GPS) without such a constraint.

While traditional low-rank approximations often rely on static rank assumptions--limiting their flexibility across diverse input contexts--our method dynamically selects ranks based on real-time sequence dynamics, layer-specific sensitivities, and hardware constraints. The core innovation lies in an RL agent that formulates rank selection as a sequential policy optimization problem, where the reward function strictly balances attention fidelity against computational latency. Crucially, we employ online matrix perturbation bounds to enable incremental rank updates, thereby avoiding the prohibitive cost of full decomposition during inference. Furthermore, the integration of a lightweight Transformer-based policy network and batched Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) operations ensures scalable deployment on modern GPU architectures. Experiments demonstrate that DR-RL maintains downstream accuracy statistically equivalent to full-rank attention while significantly reducing Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), particularly in long-sequence regimes (L > 4096). This work bridges the gap between adaptive efficiency and theoretical rigor in MHSA, offering a principled, mathematically grounded alternative to heuristic rank reduction techniques in resource-constrained deep learning.

We study the following fundamental setting for learning features in superposition from black-box query access: we are given query access to a function \\[ f(x)=\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\\,σ_i(v_i^\\top x), \\] where each unit vector $v_i$ encodes a feature direction and $σ_i:\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is an arbitrary response function and our goal is to recover the $v_i$ and the function $f$.\n  In learning-theoretic terms, superposition refers to the overcomplete regime, when the number of features is larger than the underlying dimension (i.e. $n > d$), which has proven especially challenging for typical algorithmic approaches. Our main result is an efficient query algorithm that, from noisy oracle access to $f$, identifies all feature directions whose responses are non-degenerate and reconstructs the function $f$. Crucially, our algorithm works in a significantly more general setting than all related prior results -- we allow for essentially arbitrary superpositions, only requiring that $v_i, v_j$ are not nearly identical for $i \\neq j$, and general response functions $σ_i$. At a high level, our algorithm introduces an approach for searching in Fourier space by iteratively refining the search space to locate the hidden directions $v_i$."}

Despite progress in improving visual realism through advanced simulators and generative AI, recent studies reveal that pixel-level fidelity alone does not ensure reliable transfer from simulation to the real world. What truly matters is whether the system-under-test (SUT) bases its decisions on the same causal evidence in both real and simulated environments - not just whether images \"look real\" to humans. This paper addresses the lack of such a behavior-grounded fidelity measure by introducing Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new SUT-specific metric that extends the existing fidelity spectrum to capture mechanism parity - the agreement in causal evidence underlying the SUT's decisions across domains. DFF leverages explainable-AI (XAI) methods to identify and compare the decisive features driving the SUT's outputs for matched real-synthetic pairs. We further propose practical estimators based on counterfactual explanations, along with a DFF-guided calibration scheme to enhance simulator fidelity. Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs demonstrate that DFF reveals discrepancies overlooked by conventional output-value fidelity. Furthermore, results show that DFF-guided calibration improves decisive-feature and input-level fidelity without sacrificing output value fidelity across diverse SUTs."}

Conventional approaches often rely on location-independent parameterizations and independent training, underutilizing transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity in the inputs, and limiting their applicability in regions with substantial variability. We propose FTBSC-KGML (Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration-Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning), a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based, spatial-variability-aware, and knowledge-guided machine learning framework that augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process and site-specific parameters.

Empirically, FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and greater consistency in explanatory power than a purely global model, thereby better capturing spatial variability across states.

Although graphics processors dominate modern artificial-intelligence deployment, most consumer hardware--including laptops, desktops, industrial controllers, and embedded systems--relies on central processing units. Despite this, the computational laws governing central-processing-unit-only inference for local language and vision-language workloads remain largely unexplored. We systematically benchmark large language and vision-language models on two representative central-processing-unit tiers widely used for local inference: a MacBook Pro M2, reflecting mainstream laptop-class deployment, and a Raspberry Pi 5, representing constrained, low-power embedded settings. Using a unified methodology based on continuous sampling of processor and memory usage together with area-under-curve integration, we characterize how computational load scales with input text length for language models and with image resolution for vision-language models. We uncover two empirical scaling laws: (1) computational cost for language-model inference scales approximately linearly with token length; and (2) vision-language models exhibit a preprocessing-driven \"resolution knee\", where compute remains constant above an internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Beyond these laws, we show that quantum-inspired compression reduces processor and memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy consumption by up to 62%, while preserving or improving semantic accuracy. These results provide a systematic quantification of multimodal central-processing-unit-only scaling for local language and vision-language workloads, and they identify model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective, low-cost levers for sustainable edge inference."}

However, they suffer from diseconomies of scale, and their financial viability remains unconvincing. One step in addressing this shortcoming is to design these reactors with comprehensive economic and physics analyses informing early-stage design iteration. In this work, we present a novel unifying geometric design optimization approach that accounts for techno-economic considerations. We start by generating random samples to train surrogate models, including Gaussian processes (GPs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We then deploy these surrogates within a reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization framework to optimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), all the while imposing constraints on the fuel lifetime, shutdown margin (SDM), peak heat flux, and rod-integrated peaking factor. We study two cases: one in which the axial reflector cost is very high, and one in which it is inexpensive. We found that the operation and maintenance and capital costs are the primary contributors to the overall LCOE particularly the cost of the axial reflectors (for the first case) and the control drum materials. The optimizer cleverly changes the design parameters so as to minimize one of them while still satisfying the constraints, ultimately reducing the LCOE by more than 57% in both instances. A comprehensive integration of fuel and HP performance with multi-objective optimization is currently being pursued to fully understand the interaction between constraints and cost performance."}

Using recruitment as an example use case, we simulate the behavior of a memory-enhanced personalized agent, and study whether and how bias is introduced and amplified in and across various stages of operation. Our experiments on agents using safety-trained LLMs reveal that bias is systematically introduced and reinforced through personalization, emphasizing the need for additional protective measures or agent guardrails in memory-enhanced LLM-based AI agents."}

We propose CauStream, a unified framework for causal spatiotemporal streamflow forecasting. CauSTream jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph among meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations. We further establish identifiability conditions for these causal structures under a nonparametric setting. We evaluate CauSTream on three major U.S. river basins across three forecasting horizons. The model consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, with performance gaps widening at longer forecast windows, indicating stronger generalization to unseen conditions. Beyond forecasting, CauSTream also learns causal graphs that capture relationships among hydrological factors and stations. The inferred structures align closely with established domain knowledge, offering interpretable insights into watershed dynamics.

ICL had originally been thought to emerge from the self-attention mechanism in autoregressive transformer architectures. DeepOSets is a non-autoregressive, non-attention based neural architecture that combines set learning via the DeepSets architecture with operator learning via Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). In a previous study, DeepOSets was shown to display ICL capabilities in supervised learning problems. In this paper, we show that the DeepOSets architecture, with the appropriate modifications, is a multi-operator in-context learner that can recover the solution operator of a new PDE, not seen during training, from example pairs of parameter and solution placed in a user prompt, without any weight updates. Furthermore, we show that DeepOSets is a universal uniform approximator over a class of continuous operators, which we believe is the first result of its kind in the literature of scientific machine learning. This means that a single DeepOSets architecture exists that approximates in-context any continuous operator in the class to any fixed desired degree accuracy, given an appropriate number of examples in the prompt. Experiments with Poisson and reaction-diffusion forward and inverse boundary-value problems demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to use in-context examples to predict accurately the solutions corresponding to parameter queries for PDEs not seen during training."}

During inference, the method requires only a single log-probability computation over the probe prefixes to produce a harmfulness score and apply a threshold, without invoking any additional models or multi-stage inference. To further enhance the discriminative power of the prefixes, we design an efficient prefix construction algorithm that automatically discovers highly informative prefixes, substantially improving detection performance.

In this work, we show that practical implementations of Gaussian blurring are reversible enough to break privacy. We then take a closer look at the privacy-utility tradeoffs offered by three other obfuscation algorithms -- pixelization, pixelization and noise addition (DP-Pix), and cropping. Privacy is evaluated by reversal and discrimination attacks, while utility by the quality of the learnt representations when the model is trained on data with obfuscated faces. We show that the most popular industry-standard method, Gaussian blur is the least private of the four -- being susceptible to reversal attacks in its practical low-precision implementations. In contrast, pixelization and pixelization plus noise addition, when used at the right level of granularity, offer both privacy and utility for a number of computer vision tasks. We make our proposed methods together with suggested parameters available in a software package called Privacy Blur."}

We are witnessing the rise of a dangerous literacy gap, where a focus on the functional, operational skills of using AI tools is eclipsing the development of critical and ethical reasoning about them. This position paper argues for a systemic shift toward comprehensive AI literacy that centers human agency - the empowered capacity for intentional, critical, and responsible choice. This principle applies to all stakeholders in the educational ecosystem: it is the student's agency to question, create with, or consciously decide not to use AI based on the task; it is the teacher's agency to design learning experiences that align with instructional values, rather than ceding pedagogical control to a tool. True literacy involves teaching about agency itself, framing technology not as an inevitability to be adopted, but as a choice to be made. This requires a deep commitment to critical thinking and a robust understanding of epistemology. Through the AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks described in this paper, educators and students will become agents in their own human-centric approaches to AI, providing necessary pathways to clearly articulate the intentions informing decisions and attitudes toward AI and the impact of these decisions on academic work, career, and society."}

We present AIMM, an AI-driven framework that fuses Reddit activity, bot and coordination indicators, and OHLCV market features into a daily AIMM Manipulation Risk Score for each ticker.\n  The system uses a parquet-native pipeline with a Streamlit dashboard that allows analysts to explore suspicious windows, inspect underlying posts and price action, and log model outputs over time. Due to Reddit API restrictions, we employ calibrated synthetic social features matching documented event characteristics; market data (OHLCV) uses real historical data from Yahoo Finance. This release makes three contributions. First, we build the AIMM Ground Truth dataset (AIMM-GT): 33 labeled ticker-days spanning eight equities, drawing from SEC enforcement actions, community-verified manipulation cases, and matched normal controls. Second, we implement forward-walk evaluation and prospective prediction logging for both retrospective and deployment-style assessment. Third, we analyze lead times and show that AIMM flagged GME 22 days before the January 2021 squeeze peak.\n  The current labeled set is small (33 ticker-days, 3 positive events), but results show preliminary discriminative capability and early warnings for the GME incident. We release the code, dataset schema, and dashboard design to support research on social media-driven market surveillance."}

Based on a literature review, the unsupervised learning approach with the Apriori algorithm has proven effective in identifying association patterns and semantic relations in unlabeled text data. The dataset used is the Indonesian Translation of the hadith of Bukhari, which first goes through preprocessing stages including case folding, punctuation cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. Next, an association rule mining analysis was conducted using the Apriori algorithm with support, confidence, and lift parameters. The results show the existence of meaningful association patterns such as the relationship between rakaat-prayer, verse-revelation, and hadith-story, which describe the themes of worship, revelation, and hadith narration. These findings demonstrate that the Apriori algorithm has the ability to automatically uncover latent semantic relationships, while contributing to the development of digital Islamic studies and technology-based learning systems."}

Under a linear Gaussian structural equation model (SEM) with equal noise variances, the problem is identifiable and we show that the ensemble precision matrix of the observations exhibits a distinctive structure that facilitates DAG recovery. Exploiting this property, we propose BUILD (Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs), a deterministic stepwise algorithm that identifies leaf nodes and their parents, then prunes the leaves by removing incident edges to proceed to the next step, exactly reconstructing the DAG from the true precision matrix. In practice, precision matrices must be estimated from finite data, and ill-conditioning may lead to error accumulation across BUILD steps. As a mitigation strategy, we periodically re-estimate the precision matrix (with less variables as leaves are pruned), trading off runtime for enhanced robustness. Reproducible results on challenging synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BUILD compares favorably to state-of-the-art DAG learning algorithms, while offering an explicit handle on complexity."}

We systematically compare single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math. For open-source models, multi-agent consistently improves performance. For example, Qwen-2.5-VL (7B) gains +6.8 points and Qwen-2.5-VL (32B) gains +3.3 on Geometry3K, and both Qwen-2.5-VL variants see further gains on OlympiadBench and We-Math. In contrast, the closed-source Gemini-2.0-Flash generally performs better in single-agent mode on classic benchmarks, while multi-agent yields only modest improvements on the newer We-Math dataset. These findings show that multi-agent pipelines provide clear benefits for open-source models and can assist strong proprietary systems on newer, less familiar benchmarks, but agentic decomposition is not universally optimal.

While it protects the rights of users requesting unlearning, it also introduces new privacy risks. Prior works have primarily focused on the privacy of data that has been unlearned, while the risks to retained data remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the privacy risks of retained data and, for the first time, reveal the vulnerabilities introduced by machine unlearning under the dual-view setting, where an adversary can query both the original and the unlearned models. From an information-theoretic perspective, we introduce the concept of {privacy knowledge gain} and demonstrate that the dual-view setting allows adversaries to obtain more information than querying either model alone, thereby amplifying privacy leakage. To effectively demonstrate this threat, we propose DVIA, a Dual-View Inference Attack, which extracts membership information on retained data using black-box queries to both models. DVIA eliminates the need to train an attack model and employs a lightweight likelihood ratio inference module for efficient inference. Experiments across different datasets and model architectures validate the effectiveness of DVIA and highlight the privacy risks inherent in the dual-view setting."}

This paper proposes \\emph{Cyber Humanism in Education} as a framework for reclaiming human agency in this landscape. We conceptualise AI-enabled learning environments as socio-technical infrastructures co-authored by humans and machines, and position educators and learners as epistemic agents and \\emph{algorithmic citizens} who have both the right and the responsibility to shape these infrastructures.\n  We articulate three pillars for cyber-humanist design, \\emph{reflexive competence}, \\emph{algorithmic citizenship}, and \\emph{dialogic design}, and relate them to major international digital and AI competence frameworks. We then present higher-education case studies that operationalise these ideas through \\emph{prompt-based learning} and a new \\emph{Conversational AI Educator} certification within the EPICT ecosystem.

Cube drawings are modeled as graphs with node features encoding spatial coordinates, local graphlet-based topology, and angular geometry, which are processed using graph neural networks and fused with age, education, and NPT features in a late-fusion model. Experimental results show that graph-based representations provide a strong unimodal baseline and substantially outperform pixel-based convolutional models, while multimodal integration further improves performance and robustness to class imbalance. SHAP-based interpretability analysis identifies specific graphlet motifs and geometric distortions as key predictors, closely aligning with clinical observations of disorganized cube drawings in AD.

Rapid mass flows, including landslides and avalanches, cause several thousand deaths across a wide range of environments, often travelling many kilometres from their source. The wide range of source conditions and material properties governing these flows makes their runout difficult to anticipate, particularly for downstream communities that may be suddenly exposed to severe impacts. Accurately predicting runout at scale requires models that are both physically realistic and computationally efficient, yet existing approaches face a fundamental speed-realism trade-off. Here we train a machine learning model to predict geohazard runout across representative real world terrains. The model predicts both flow extent and deposit thickness with high accuracy and 100 to 10,000 times faster computation than numerical solvers. It is trained on over 100,000 numerical simulations across over 10,000 real world digital elevation model chips and reproduces key physical behaviours, including avulsion and deposition patterns, while generalizing across different flow types, sizes and landscapes. Our results demonstrate that neural emulation enables rapid, spatially resolved runout prediction across diverse real world terrains, opening new opportunities for disaster risk reduction and impact-based forecasting.

Existing methods typically treat all OOD samples as a single class, despite real-world applications, especially high-stake settings such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis, demanding deeper insights into OOD samples, including their probable labels. This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility. Experimental results show that CFC improves OOD detection by ten percent over state-of-the-art methods on graph and text domains and achieves up to seventy percent accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets."}

Federated graph learning (FGL) addresses this by enabling collaborative GNN model training without sharing private data. However, a core challenge in FGL systems is the variation in local training data distributions among clients, known as the data heterogeneity problem. Most existing solutions suffer from two problems: (1) The typical optimizer based on empirical risk minimization tends to cause local models to fall into sharp valleys and weakens their generalization to out-of-distribution graph data. (2) The prevalent dimensional collapse in the learned representations of local graph data has an adverse impact on the classification capacity of the GNN model. To this end, we formulate a novel optimization objective that is aware of the sharpness (i.e., the curvature of the loss surface) of local GNN models. By minimizing the loss function and its sharpness simultaneously, we seek out model parameters in a flat region with uniformly low loss values, thus improving the generalization over heterogeneous data. By introducing a regularizer based on the correlation matrix of local representations, we relax the correlations of representations generated by individual local graph samples, so as to alleviate the dimensional collapse of the learned model.

Recent studies suggest that machine unlearning can help ensure deployed models comply with evolving legal, safety, and governance requirements. However, current unlearning techniques assume clean separation between forget and retain datasets, which is challenging in operational settings characterized by highly entangled distributions. In such scenarios, perturbation-based methods often degrade general model utility or fail to ensure safety. To address this, we propose Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), a novel principled activation-editing framework that enforces feature-aware and directionally controlled perturbations. Unlike indiscriminate model weights perturbations, SRMU employs a structured misdirection vector with an activation importance map. The goal is to allow SRMU selectively suppresses harmful representations while preserving the utility on benign ones. Experiments are conducted on the widely used WMDP benchmark across low- and high-entanglement configurations. Empirical results reveal that SRMU delivers state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility losses, and remains effective under 20-30\\% overlap where existing baselines collapse.

To date, quantitative verification has been explored almost exclusively for deep neural networks (DNNs). Representative methods, such as DeepGemini and FairQuant, all build on the core idea of Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement, a generic framework that could be adapted to other model classes. We extended the framework into a model-agnostic form, but discovered two limitations: (i) it can provide only lower bounds, and (ii) its performance scales poorly.

One of the critical challenges is the continuous emergence of new applications, which generates Out-of-Distribution (OOD) traffic patterns that deviate from known categories and are not well represented by predefined models. Current approaches rely on predefined categories, which limits their effectiveness in handling unknown traffic types. Although some methods mitigate this limitation by simply classifying unknown traffic into a single \"Other\" category, they fail to make a fine-grained classification. In this paper, we propose a Two-stage Adaptive OOD classification Network (TAO-Net) that achieves accurate classification for both In-Distribution (ID) and OOD encrypted traffic. The method incorporates an innovative two-stage design: the first stage employs a hybrid OOD detection mechanism that integrates transformer-based inter-layer transformation smoothness and feature analysis to effectively distinguish between ID and OOD traffic, while the second stage leverages large language models with a novel semantic-enhanced prompt strategy to transform OOD traffic classification into a generation task, enabling flexible fine-grained classification without relying on predefined labels. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TAO-Net achieves 96.81-97.70% macro-precision and 96.77-97.68% macro-F1, outperforming previous methods that only reach 44.73-86.30% macro-precision, particularly in identifying emerging network applications."}

However, existing research faces two limitations: (1) the high complexity of optimizing water-nitrogen combinations during crop growth and poor yield optimization results; and (2) the difficulty in quantifying mild stress signals and the delayed feedback, which results in less precise dynamic regulation of water and nitrogen and lower resource utilization efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method. The parent agent in NDRL identifies promising macroscopic irrigation and fertilization actions based on projected cumulative yield benefits, reducing ineffective explorationwhile maintaining alignment between objectives and yield. The child agent's reward function incorporates quantified Water Stress Factor (WSF) and Nitrogen Stress Factor (NSF), and uses a mixed probability distribution to dynamically optimize daily strategies, thereby enhancing both yield and resource efficiency. We used field experiment data from 2023 and 2024 to calibrate and validate the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) to simulate real-world conditions and interact with NDRL. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the best baseline, the simulated yield increased by 4.7% in both 2023 and 2024, the irrigation water productivity increased by 5.6% and 5.1% respectively, and the nitrogen partial factor productivity increased by 6.3% and 1.0% respectively.

To address this, we propose CSA-TTA, a novel Cross-Sample Augmented Test-Time Adaptation framework that enhances training by incorporating hypotension events from other individuals. Specifically, we first construct a cross-sample bank by segmenting historical data into hypotensive and non-hypotensive samples. Then, we introduce a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy for building test-time training data: we initially apply K-Shape clustering to identify representative cluster centers and subsequently retrieve the top-K semantically similar samples based on the current patient signal. Additionally, we integrate both self-supervised masked reconstruction and retrospective sequence forecasting signals during training to enhance model adaptability to rapid and subtle intraoperative dynamics. We evaluate the proposed CSA-TTA on both the VitalDB dataset and a real-world in-hospital dataset by integrating it with state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, including TimesFM and UniTS. CSA-TTA consistently enhances performance across settings-for instance, on VitalDB, it improves Recall and F1 scores by +1.33% and +1.13%, respectively, under fine-tuning, and by +7.46% and +5.07% in zero-shot scenarios-demonstrating strong robustness and generalization."}

Building on this formulation, we introduce the Geometric Laplace Neural Operator (GLNO), which embeds the Laplace spectral representation into the eigen-basis of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, extending operator learning to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds without requiring periodicity or uniform grids.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA reduce this cost by adding small low-rank updates to frozen model weights. However, these methods restrict the training to a limited subspace, which can sometimes reduce performance.\n  For Small Language Models (SLMs), where efficiency gains matter even more, we introduce AdaGradSelect, an adaptive method that selects which transformer blocks to update based on gradients.\n  Early observations showed that updating only the transformer blocks with the highest gradient norms can achieve performance close to full fine-tuning. Building on this insight, AdaGradSelect adaptively chooses which blocks to train. It uses a combination of Dirichlet-based sampling, which depends on how frequently blocks were updated in the past, and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. This lets the method explore different blocks in early training and gradually focus on the most important ones in later epochs.\n  Experiments show that AdaGradSelect trains about 12 percent faster and uses 35 percent less GPU memory while delivering performance very close to full fine-tuning. On the GSM8K dataset, it outperforms LoRA (rank 256) by about 3 percent on average across models such as Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA3.2-1B, and Phi4-mini-3.8B.

When partial differential equations are involved, full-order models such as those based on the Finite Element Method can make traditional sampling approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computationally infeasible. Although data-driven surrogate models may help reduce evaluation costs, their utility is often limited by the expense of generating high-fidelity data. In contrast, low-fidelity data can be produced more efficiently, although relying on them alone may degrade the accuracy of the inverse UQ solution.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme for Bayesian inverse problems. Extending the Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance framework, the method introduces multi-fidelity neural networks that combine the predictions of solvers of varying fidelity, with high fidelity evaluations restricted to an offline training stage. During the online phase, likelihood evaluations are obtained by evaluating the coarse solvers and passing their outputs to the trained neural networks, thereby avoiding additional high-fidelity simulations.\n  This construction allows heterogeneous coarse solvers to be incorporated consistently within the hierarchy, providing greater flexibility than standard Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance. The proposed approach improves the approximation accuracy of the low fidelity solvers, leading to longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and accelerated posterior inference. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated on two benchmark inverse problems involving (i) steady isotropic groundwater flow, (ii) an unsteady reaction-diffusion system, for which substantial computational savings are obtained."}

However, these models often exhibit discrepancies from the reality due to unmodeled effects or simplifying assumptions. We refer to this gap as the ignorance model. While purely data-driven approaches attempt to learn full system behavior, they require large amounts of high-quality data across the entire spatial and temporal domain. In real-world scenarios, such information is unavailable, making full data-driven modeling unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we model of the ignorance component using a hybrid twin approach, instead of simulating phenomena from scratch. Since physics-based models approximate the overall behavior of the phenomena, the remaining ignorance is typically lower in complexity than the full physical response, therefore, it can be learned with significantly fewer data. A key difficulty, however, is that spatial measurements are sparse, also obtaining data measuring the same phenomenon for different spatial configurations is challenging in practice. Our contribution is to overcome this limitation by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the ignorance model. GNNs learn the spatial pattern of the missing physics even when the number of measurement locations is limited. This allows us to enrich the physics-based model with data-driven corrections without requiring dense spatial, temporal and parametric data. To showcase the performance of the proposed method, we evaluate this GNN-based hybrid twin on nonlinear heat transfer problems across different meshes, geometries, and load positions. Results show that the GNN successfully captures the ignorance and generalizes corrections across spatial configurations, improving simulation accuracy and interpretability, while minimizing data requirements."}

To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors.

However, it is non-trivial to address the following challenges: how to match the base model's denoising quality at lower cost under time-varying task difficulty in embodied settings, and how to dynamically and interactively adjust computation based on task difficulty in such environments. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Reinforcement-based Speculative Diffusion Policy (TS-DP), the first framework that enables speculative decoding for DP with temporal adaptivity. First, to handle dynamic environments where task difficulty varies over time, we distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model and replace its costly denoising calls. Second, an RL-based scheduler further adapts to time-varying task difficulty by adjusting speculative parameters to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency.

Under a fixed evaluation budget, we compare four families of optimizers: two hand-designed evolutionary methods - Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Evolution Strategy (ES) - and two learned, amortized approaches, Preferential Amortized Black-Box Optimization (PABBO) and Sharpness-Aware Black-Box Optimization (SABBO). Our experiments show that, while GA, ES, PABBO, and SABBO eventually reach a similar band of final perplexity, the amortized optimizers are substantially more sample- and time-efficient.

One of the applications of the IoT is in the field of medicine, which is called the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer categorized as a hematic disease. It usually begins in the bone marrow due to the overproduction of immature White Blood Cells (WBCs or leukocytes). Since it has a high rate of spread to other body organs, it is a fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated early. Therefore, for identifying cancerous (ALL) cells in medical diagnostic laboratories, blood, as well as bone marrow smears, are taken by pathologists. However, manual examinations face limitations due to human error risk and time-consuming procedures. So, to tackle the mentioned issues, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), capable of identifying cancer from non-cancer tissue, seem vital. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most efficient machine learning (ML) methods. These techniques employ multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the raw input. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied along with a new type of classifier, Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), to categorize ALL and normal (healthy) cells from microscopic blood images. We employed the model on IoMT structure to identify leukemia quickly and safely. With the help of this new leukemia classification framework, patients and clinicians can have real-time communication. The model was implemented on the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database (ALL-IDB2) and achieved an average accuracy of %98.88 in the test step."}

We study the following fundamental setting for learning features in superposition from black-box query access: we are given query access to a function \\[ f(x)=\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\\,σ_i(v_i^\\top x), \\] where each unit vector $v_i$ encodes a feature direction and $σ_i:\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is an arbitrary response function and our goal is to recover the $v_i$ and the function $f$.\n  In learning-theoretic terms, superposition refers to the overcomplete regime, when the number of features is larger than the underlying dimension (i.e. $n > d$), which has proven especially challenging for typical algorithmic approaches. Our main result is an efficient query algorithm that, from noisy oracle access to $f$, identifies all feature directions whose responses are non-degenerate and reconstructs the function $f$. Crucially, our algorithm works in a significantly more general setting than all related prior results -- we allow for essentially arbitrary superpositions, only requiring that $v_i, v_j$ are not nearly identical for $i \\neq j$, and general response functions $σ_i$. At a high level, our algorithm introduces an approach for searching in Fourier space by iteratively refining the search space to locate the hidden directions $v_i$."}

Detecting clusters in exploratory data analyses (EDA) requires algorithms that make few assumptions about the data. Density-based clustering algorithms are particularly well-suited for EDA because they describe high-density regions, assuming only that a density exists. Applying density-based clustering algorithms in practice, however, requires selecting appropriate hyperparameters, which is difficult without prior knowledge of the data distribution. For example, DBSCAN requires selecting a density threshold, and HDBSCAN* relies on a minimum cluster size parameter. In this work, we propose Persistent Leaves Spatial Clustering for Applications with Noise (PLSCAN). This novel density-based clustering algorithm efficiently identifies all minimum cluster sizes for which HDBSCAN* produces stable (leaf) clusters. PLSCAN applies scale-space clustering principles and is equivalent to persistent homology on a novel metric space. We compare its performance to HDBSCAN* on several real-world datasets, demonstrating that it achieves a higher average ARI and is less sensitive to changes in the number of mutual reachability neighbours. Additionally, we compare PLSCAN's computational costs to k-Means, demonstrating competitive run-times on low-dimensional datasets. At higher dimensions, run times scale more similarly to HDBSCAN*."}

However, both transfer learning and the exploitation of spatial variability in this field are challenging, as they involve heterogeneous data and complex cross-scale dependencies. Conventional approaches often rely on location-independent parameterizations and independent training, underutilizing transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity in the inputs, and limiting their applicability in regions with substantial variability. We propose FTBSC-KGML (Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration-Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning), a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based, spatial-variability-aware, and knowledge-guided machine learning framework that augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process and site-specific parameters. Using a pretraining-fine-tuning process with remote-sensing GPP, climate, and soil covariates collected across multiple midwestern sites, FTBSC-KGML estimates land emissions while leveraging transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity. A key component is a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme, which is a globally pretrained model that is fine-tuned at each state or site to learn place-aware representations, thereby improving local accuracy under limited data without sacrificing interpretability. Empirically, FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and greater consistency in explanatory power than a purely global model, thereby better capturing spatial variability across states.

SLHF frames the alignment problem as a sequential-move game between two policies: a Leader, which commits to an action, and a Follower, which responds conditionally on the Leader's action. This approach decomposes preference optimization into a refinement problem for the Follower and an optimization problem against an adversary for the Leader. Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which assigns scalar rewards to actions, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), which seeks a simultaneous-move equilibrium, SLHF leverages the asymmetry of sequential play to capture richer preference structures. The sequential design of SLHF naturally enables inference-time refinement, as the Follower learns to improve the Leader's actions, and these refinements can be leveraged through iterative sampling. We compare the solution concepts of SLHF, RLHF, and NLHF, and lay out key advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences. Experiments on large language models demonstrate that SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse preference datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and yields inference-time refinements that transfer across model families without further fine-tuning."}

Recent causal learning approaches address these issues by integrating domain knowledge, yet they typically rely on fixed causal graphs that fail to adapt to data. We propose CauStream, a unified framework for causal spatiotemporal streamflow forecasting. CauSTream jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph among meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations. We further establish identifiability conditions for these causal structures under a nonparametric setting. We evaluate CauSTream on three major U.S. river basins across three forecasting horizons. The model consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, with performance gaps widening at longer forecast windows, indicating stronger generalization to unseen conditions. Beyond forecasting, CauSTream also learns causal graphs that capture relationships among hydrological factors and stations. The inferred structures align closely with established domain knowledge, offering interpretable insights into watershed dynamics. CauSTream offers a principled foundation for causal spatiotemporal modeling, with the potential to extend to a wide range of scientific and environmental applications."}

However, practical deployment of deep learning-based RFFI models is hindered by a critical challenge: their performance often degrades significantly when applied across receivers with different hardware characteristics due to distribution shifts introduced by receiver variation. To address this, we investigate the source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI (SCRFFI) problem, where a model pretrained on labeled signals from a source receiver must adapt to unlabeled signals from a target receiver, without access to any source-domain data during adaptation. We first formulate a novel constrained pseudo-labeling-based SCRFFI adaptation framework, and provide a theoretical analysis of its generalization performance. Our analysis highlights a key insight: the target-domain performance is highly sensitive to the quality of the pseudo-labels generated during adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), a new method for SCRFFI that incorporates momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and enforces global structural constraints to encourage confident and diverse predictions. Notably, MS-SHOT effectively addresses scenarios involving label shift or unknown, non-uniform class distributions in the target domain -- a significant limitation of prior methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MS-SHOT consistently outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness, offering a practical and scalable solution for source-data-free cross-receiver adaptation in RFFI."}

DataFlow is designed with system-level abstractions that enable modular, reusable, and composable data transformations, and provides a PyTorch-style pipeline construction API for building debuggable and optimizable dataflows.

Rapid mass flows, including landslides and avalanches, cause several thousand deaths across a wide range of environments, often travelling many kilometres from their source. The wide range of source conditions and material properties governing these flows makes their runout difficult to anticipate, particularly for downstream communities that may be suddenly exposed to severe impacts. Accurately predicting runout at scale requires models that are both physically realistic and computationally efficient, yet existing approaches face a fundamental speed-realism trade-off. Here we train a machine learning model to predict geohazard runout across representative real world terrains. The model predicts both flow extent and deposit thickness with high accuracy and 100 to 10,000 times faster computation than numerical solvers. It is trained on over 100,000 numerical simulations across over 10,000 real world digital elevation model chips and reproduces key physical behaviours, including avulsion and deposition patterns, while generalizing across different flow types, sizes and landscapes. Our results demonstrate that neural emulation enables rapid, spatially resolved runout prediction across diverse real world terrains, opening new opportunities for disaster risk reduction and impact-based forecasting.

CLARiTy employs multiple class-specific tokens to generate discriminative attention maps, and a SegmentCAM module for foreground segmentation and background suppression using explicit anatomical priors. Trained on image-level labels from the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, it leverages distillation from a ConvNeXtV2 teacher for efficiency.

In particular, pronounced gains occur for small pathologies like nodules and masses. The lower-resolution variant of CLARiTy, CLARiTy-S-16-224, offers high efficiency while decisively surpassing baselines, thereby having the potential for use in low-resource settings.

This paper is a thorough guide to examine the changing reranker landscape and offer a clear view of the advancements made in reranking methods. We present a comprehensive survey of reranking models employed in IR, particularly within modern Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, where retrieved documents notably influence output quality.\n  We embark on a chronological journey through the historical trajectory of reranking techniques, starting with foundational approaches, before exploring the wide range of sophisticated neural network architectures such as cross-encoders, sequence-generation models like T5, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) utilized for structural information. Recognizing the computational cost of advancing neural rerankers, we analyze techniques for enhancing efficiency, notably knowledge distillation for creating competitive, lighter alternatives. Furthermore, we map the emerging territory of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in reranking, examining novel prompting strategies and fine-tuning tactics. This survey seeks to elucidate the fundamental ideas, relative effectiveness, computational features, and real-world trade-offs of various reranking strategies. The survey provides a structured synthesis of the diverse reranking paradigms, highlighting their underlying principles and comparative strengths and weaknesses."}

Existing methods typically treat all OOD samples as a single class, despite real-world applications, especially high-stake settings such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis, demanding deeper insights into OOD samples, including their probable labels. This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility. Experimental results show that CFC improves OOD detection by ten percent over state-of-the-art methods on graph and text domains and achieves up to seventy percent accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets."}

Recent studies suggest that machine unlearning can help ensure deployed models comply with evolving legal, safety, and governance requirements. However, current unlearning techniques assume clean separation between forget and retain datasets, which is challenging in operational settings characterized by highly entangled distributions. In such scenarios, perturbation-based methods often degrade general model utility or fail to ensure safety. To address this, we propose Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), a novel principled activation-editing framework that enforces feature-aware and directionally controlled perturbations. Unlike indiscriminate model weights perturbations, SRMU employs a structured misdirection vector with an activation importance map. The goal is to allow SRMU selectively suppresses harmful representations while preserving the utility on benign ones. Experiments are conducted on the widely used WMDP benchmark across low- and high-entanglement configurations. Empirical results reveal that SRMU delivers state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility losses, and remains effective under 20-30\\% overlap where existing baselines collapse. SRMU provides a robust foundation for safety-driven model governance, privacy compliance, and controlled knowledge removal in the emerging LLM-based applications.

However, these mechanisms lack theoretical grounding and cannot support context-aware selection from latent state dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose KOSS, a Kalman-optimal Selective State Space model that formulates selection as latent state uncertainty minimization. Derived from estimation theory, KOSS adopts a continuous-time latent update driven by a Kalman gain that dynamically modulates information propagation based on content and context, enabling a closed-loop, context-aware selectivity mechanism. To ensure stable computation and near-linear scalability, KOSS employs global spectral differentiation for frequency-domain derivative estimation, along with a segment-wise scan for hardware-efficient processing. On a selective copying task with distractors, KOSS achieves over 79\\% accuracy while baselines drop below 20\\%, demonstrating robust context-aware selection. Furthermore, across nine long-term forecasting benchmarks, KOSS reduces MSE by 2.92--36.23\\% and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and stability. To assess real-world applicability, a case study on secondary surveillance radar (SSR) tracking confirms KOSS's robustness under irregular intervals and noisy conditions and demonstrates its effectiveness in real-world applications. Finally, supplementary experiments verify Kalman gain convergence and the frequency response of spectral differentiation, providing theoretical support for the proposed closed-loop design."}

Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy. Kascade achieves up to 4.1x speedup in decode attention and 2.2x speedup in prefill attention over FlashAttention-3 baseline on H100 GPUs while closely matching dense attention accuracy on long-context benchmarks such as LongBench and AIME-24."}

Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation.

To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation.

Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.\n  We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes."}

It usually begins in the bone marrow due to the overproduction of immature White Blood Cells (WBCs or leukocytes). Since it has a high rate of spread to other body organs, it is a fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated early. Therefore, for identifying cancerous (ALL) cells in medical diagnostic laboratories, blood, as well as bone marrow smears, are taken by pathologists. However, manual examinations face limitations due to human error risk and time-consuming procedures. So, to tackle the mentioned issues, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), capable of identifying cancer from non-cancer tissue, seem vital. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most efficient machine learning (ML) methods. These techniques employ multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the raw input.

Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which assigns scalar rewards to actions, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), which seeks a simultaneous-move equilibrium, SLHF leverages the asymmetry of sequential play to capture richer preference structures. The sequential design of SLHF naturally enables inference-time refinement, as the Follower learns to improve the Leader's actions, and these refinements can be leveraged through iterative sampling. We compare the solution concepts of SLHF, RLHF, and NLHF, and lay out key advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences. Experiments on large language models demonstrate that SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse preference datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and yields inference-time refinements that transfer across model families without further fine-tuning."}

In this paper, we present LaMer, a general Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore and learn from the environment feedback at test time. LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively.

In this work we seek to understand how the pretrained policy affects finetuning performance, and how to pretrain policies in order to ensure they are effective initializations for finetuning. We first show theoretically that standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- which trains a policy to directly match the actions played by the demonstrator -- can fail to ensure coverage over the demonstrator's actions, a minimal condition necessary for effective RL finetuning.

Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training."}

We evaluated 13 experiments spanning fundamental optics (Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, Michelson/Mach-Zehnder interferometry, Bell states, delayed-choice quantum eraser), quantum information protocols (BB84 QKD, Franson interferometry, GHZ states, quantum teleportation, hyperentanglement), and advanced technologies (boson sampling, electromagnetically induced transparency, frequency conversion). The system achieves design-simulation alignment scores of 8--9/10, with simulations faithfully modeling intended physics. A critical finding distinguishes structural correctness from quantitative accuracy: high alignment confirms correct physics architecture, while numerical predictions require expert review. Free-form simulation outperformed constrained frameworks for 11/13 experiments, revealing that quantum optics diversity demands flexible mathematical representations.

The approach mirrors the way in which epidemiologists enable public health interventions through statistical evidence before molecular mechanisms are understood. This bypasses the problem of model complexity which plagues current interpretability methods (such as SHAP and mechanistic interpretability) at the scale of deployed models.\n  AI Epidemiology achieves this population-level surveillance by standardising capture of AI-expert interactions into structured assessment fields: risk level, alignment score, and accuracy score. These function as exposure variables which predict output failure through statistical associations, much like cholesterol and blood pressure act as exposure variables predicting cardiac events. Output-failure associations are subsequently validated against expert overrides and real-world outcomes.\n  The framework places zero burden on experts and provides automatic audit trails by passively tracking expert convergence and divergence with AI recommendations. Since it analyses outputs rather than internal model computations, it also provides governance continuity when institutions update models and switch vendors. Finally, by providing reliability scores and semantic assessments (e.g. 'this recommendation resembles 500 cases overridden by experts due to guideline violations'), it enables experts and institutions to detect unreliable AI outputs before they cause harm. This democratises AI oversight by enabling domain experts to govern AI systems without requiring machine learning expertise."}

However, current model-centric agent architectures struggle to self-evolve post-deployment: improving personalization, capability, and efficiency typically requires continuous model retraining/fine-tuning, which incurs prohibitive computational overheads and suffers from an inherent trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency.\n  To enable iterative self-evolution without model retraining, we propose MOBIMEM, a memory-centric agent system. MOBIMEM first introduces three specialized memory primitives to decouple agent evolution from model weights: (1) Profile Memory uses a lightweight distance-graph (DisGraph) structure to align with user preferences, resolving the accuracy-latency trade-off in user profile retrieval; (2) Experience Memory employs multi-level templates to instantiate execution logic for new tasks, ensuring capability generalization; and (3) Action Memory records fine-grained interaction sequences, reducing the reliance on expensive model inference. Building upon this memory architecture, MOBIMEM further integrates a suite of OS-inspired services to orchestrate execution: a scheduler that coordinates parallel sub-task execution and memory operations; an agent record-and-replay (AgentRR) mechanism that enables safe and efficient action reuse; and a context-aware exception handling that ensures graceful recovery from user interruptions and runtime errors.\n  Evaluation on AndroidWorld and top-50 apps shows that MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices."}
