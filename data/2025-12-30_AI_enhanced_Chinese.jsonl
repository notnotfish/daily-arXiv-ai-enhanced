Recent work has shown that many Large Language Models (LLMs) comply with requests to persuade users into harmful beliefs or actions when prompted and that model persuasiveness increases with model scale. However, this prior work looked at persuasion from the threat model of $\\textit{misuse}$ (i.e., a bad actor asking an LLM to persuade). In this paper, we instead aim to answer the following question: Under what circumstances would models persuade $\\textit{without being explicitly prompted}$, which would shape how concerned we should be about such emergent persuasion risks. To achieve this, we study unprompted persuasion under two scenarios: (i) when the model is steered (through internal activation steering) along persona traits, and (ii) when the model is supervised-finetuned (SFT) to exhibit the same traits. We showed that steering towards traits, both related to persuasion and unrelated, does not reliably increase models' tendency to persuade unprompted, however, SFT does. Moreover, SFT on general persuasion datasets containing solely benign topics admits a model that has a higher propensity to persuade on controversial and harmful topics--showing that emergent harmful persuasion can arise and should be studied further.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u7ecf\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u8bf4\u670d\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u800c\u975e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\u6027\u548c\u6709\u5bb3\u8bdd\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u503e\u5411\u4f1a\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0cAI\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c2\u70b9\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u6076\u610f\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\uff08\u5373\u88ab\u660e\u786e\u8981\u6c42\u8bf4\u670d\u7528\u6237\uff09\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u7ecf\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u793a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u81ea\u53d1\u4ea7\u751f\u8bf4\u670d\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u5174\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8003\u5bdf\u672a\u7ecf\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u76f8\u540c\u7279\u8d28\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u5728\u4ec5\u5305\u542b\u826f\u6027\u8bdd\u9898\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8bf4\u670d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884cSFT\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\u6027\u548c\u6709\u5bb3\u8bdd\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u503e\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u4e0e\u8bf4\u670d\u76f8\u5173\u8fd8\u662f\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7279\u8d28\uff09\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u7ecf\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u4f46\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u3002\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u5305\u542b\u826f\u6027\u8bdd\u9898\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8bf4\u670d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884cSFT\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\u6027\u548c\u6709\u5bb3\u8bdd\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u81ea\u53d1\u4ea7\u751f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u7ecf\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u8bf4\u670d\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u800c\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u5e94\u8be5\u5f15\u8d77\u5173\u6ce8\u5e76\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u6076\u610f\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u610f\u5916\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u8bf4\u670d\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Spatial reasoning is a key component of human intelligence, but most existing benchmarks focus on static images or final outputs, failing to account for the sequential and viewpoint-dependent nature of this skill. To close this gap, we introduce GamiBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial reasoning and 2D-to-3D planning in MLLMs through origami-inspired folding tasks. GamiBench includes 186 regular and 186 impossible 2D crease patterns paired with their corresponding 3D folded shapes, produced from six distinct viewpoints across three visual question-answering (VQA) tasks: predicting 3D fold configurations, distinguishing valid viewpoints, and detecting impossible patterns. Unlike previous benchmarks that assess only final predictions, GamiBench holistically evaluates the entire reasoning process--measuring cross-view consistency, physical feasibility through impossible-fold detection, and interpretation of intermediate folding steps. It further introduces new diagnostic metrics--viewpoint consistency (VC) and impossible fold selection rate (IFSR)--to measure how well models handle folds of varying complexity. Our experiments show that even leading models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro struggle on single-step spatial understanding.

This paper presents a fairness-aware artificial intelligence framework for prioritizing post-flood aid distribution in Bangladesh, a country highly susceptible to recurring flood disasters. Using real data from the 2022 Bangladesh floods that affected 7.2 million people and caused 405.5 million US dollars in damages, we develop an adversarial debiasing model that predicts flood vulnerability while actively removing biases against marginalized districts and rural areas. Our approach adapts fairness-aware representation learning techniques from healthcare AI to disaster management, employing a gradient reversal layer that forces the model to learn bias-invariant representations. Experimental results on 87 upazilas across 11 districts demonstrate that our framework reduces statistical parity difference by 41.6 percent, decreases regional fairness gaps by 43.2 percent, and maintains strong predictive accuracy (R-squared=0.784 vs baseline 0.811). The model generates actionable priority rankings ensuring aid reaches the most vulnerable populations based on genuine need rather than historical allocation patterns. This work demonstrates how algorithmic fairness techniques can be effectively applied to humanitarian contexts, providing decision-makers with tools to implement more equitable disaster recovery strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd\u6d2a\u6c34\u540e\u63f4\u52a9\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u53bb\u504f\u6280\u672f\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5f31\u52bf\u5730\u533a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u63f4\u52a9\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u9700\u6c42\u800c\u975e\u5386\u53f2\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u707e\u540e\u63f4\u52a9\u5206\u914d\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5f31\u52bf\u5730\u533a\u5f80\u5f80\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u5ef6\u7eed\u4e86\u5386\u53f2\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u3002\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d2a\u6c34\u9891\u53d1\u56fd\u5bb6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u63f4\u52a9\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6253\u7834\u5386\u53f2\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bf9\u5f31\u52bf\u5730\u533a\u7684\u4e0d\u5229\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u53bb\u504f\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6d2a\u6c34\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3b\u52a8\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u5730\u533a\u548c\u519c\u6751\u5730\u533a\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u501f\u9274\u533b\u7597AI\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u8f6c\u5c42\u8feb\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u89c1\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e2022\u5e74\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd\u6d2a\u6c34\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5f71\u54cd720\u4e07\u4eba\uff0c\u9020\u62104.055\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u635f\u5931\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u4e2a\u5730\u533a\u768487\u4e2aupazilas\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u7edf\u8ba1\u5947\u5076\u5dee\u5f02\u51cf\u5c1141.6%\uff0c\u533a\u57df\u516c\u5e73\u5dee\u8ddd\u51cf\u5c1143.2%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08R\u5e73\u65b9=0.784 vs \u57fa\u7ebf0.811\uff09\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u63f4\u52a9\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u516c\u5e73\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4eba\u9053\u4e3b\u4e49\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u65bd\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u707e\u540e\u6062\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6253\u7834\u5386\u53f2\u5206\u914d\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u63f4\u52a9\u771f\u6b63\u5230\u8fbe\u6700\u8106\u5f31\u4eba\u7fa4\u3002"}}

Generative Recommendation (GR) mitigates them through an end-to-end framework; however, existing methods still rely on matching mechanisms based on inductive patterns. Although responsive, they lack the ability to uncover complex user intents that require deductive reasoning based on world knowledge. Meanwhile, LLMs show strong deep reasoning capabilities, but their latency and computational costs remain challenging for industrial applications. More critically, there are performance bottlenecks in multi-scenario scalability: as shown in Figure 1, existing solutions require independent training and deployment for each scenario, leading to low resource utilization and high maintenance costs-a challenge unaddressed in GR literature. To address these, we present OxygenREC, an industrial recommendation system that leverages Fast-Slow Thinking to deliver deep reasoning with strict latency and multi-scenario requirements of real-world environments. First, we adopt a Fast-Slow Thinking architecture. Slow thinking uses a near-line LLM pipeline to synthesize Contextual Reasoning Instructions, while fast thinking employs a high-efficiency encoder--decoder backbone for real-time generation. Second, to ensure reasoning instructions effectively enhance recommendation generation, we introduce a semantic alignment mechanism with Instruction-Guided Retrieval (IGR) to filter intent-relevant historical behaviors and use a Query-to-Item (Q2I) loss for instruction-item consistency. Finally, to resolve multi-scenario scalability, we transform scenario information into controllable instructions, using unified reward mapping and Soft Adaptive Group Clip Policy Optimization (SA-GCPO) to align policies with diverse business objectives, realizing a train-once-deploy-everywhere paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "OxygenREC\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u4e1a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5feb\u6162\u601d\u7ef4\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u591a\u573a\u666f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u867d\u7136\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u4f9d\u8d56\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u7eb3\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6f14\u7ece\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0cLLM\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5bf9\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\u3002\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u591a\u573a\u666f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "1. \u91c7\u7528\u5feb\u6162\u601d\u7ef4\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u6162\u601d\u7ef4\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd1\u7ebfLLM\u7ba1\u9053\u5408\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5feb\u601d\u7ef4\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u9aa8\u5e72\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u30022. \u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4\u5f15\u5bfc\u68c0\u7d22\uff08IGR\uff09\u8fc7\u6ee4\u610f\u56fe\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u5230\u9879\u76ee\uff08Q2I\uff09\u635f\u5931\u786e\u4fdd\u6307\u4ee4-\u9879\u76ee\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u30023. \u591a\u573a\u666f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u5956\u52b1\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u8f6f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ec4\u526a\u88c1\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08SA-GCPO\uff09\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u540c\u4e1a\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\"\u4e00\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u968f\u5904\u90e8\u7f72\"\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OxygenREC\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u573a\u666f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "OxygenREC\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u6162\u601d\u7ef4\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u548c\u591a\u573a\u666f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e2\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u53c8\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This joint modeling, however, also introduces a critical weakness: perturbations or noise in either the structure or the features can be amplified through message passing, making GNNs highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and spurious connections. In this work, we introduce a pruning framework that leverages adversarial robustness evaluation to explicitly identify and remove fragile or detrimental components of the graph. By using robustness scores as guidance, our method selectively prunes edges that are most likely to degrade model reliability, thereby yielding cleaner and more resilient graph representations. We instantiate this framework on three representative GNN architectures and conduct extensive experiments on benchmarks.

This poses considerable challenges for effective organizational governance, particularly in comprehensively identifying, assessing, and mitigating diverse and evolving risks. To tackle this, we introduce the Agentic Risk \\& Capability (ARC) Framework, a technical governance framework designed to help organizations identify, assess, and mitigate risks arising from agentic AI systems. The framework's core contributions are: (1) it develops a novel capability-centric perspective to analyze a wide range of agentic AI systems; (2) it distills three primary sources of risk intrinsic to agentic AI systems - components, design, and capabilities; (3) it establishes a clear nexus between each risk source, specific materialized risks, and corresponding technical controls; and (4) it provides a structured and practical approach to help organizations implement the framework. This framework provides a robust and adaptable methodology for organizations to navigate the complexities of agentic AI, enabling rapid and effective innovation while ensuring the safe, secure, and responsible deployment of agentic AI systems.

We present a demo system that populates Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Incident Data (Form 57) from news in real time.

To solve these problems, we design a pipeline that first converts Form 57 into a JSON schema using a vision language model with sample aggregation, and then performs grouped question answering following the intent of the form layout to reduce ambiguity.

Tan", "Kazushi Ikeda"], "title": "Towards Unsupervised Causal Representation Learning via Latent Additive Noise Model Causal Autoencoders", "comment": null, "summary": "Unsupervised representation learning seeks to recover latent generative factors, yet standard methods relying on statistical independence often fail to capture causal dependencies. A central challenge is identifiability: as established in disentangled representation learning and nonlinear ICA literature, disentangling causal variables from observational data is impossible without supervision, auxiliary signals, or strong inductive biases. In this work, we propose the Latent Additive Noise Model Causal Autoencoder (LANCA) to operationalize the Additive Noise Model (ANM) as a strong inductive bias for unsupervised discovery. Theoretically, we prove that while the ANM constraint does not guarantee unique identifiability in the general mixing case, it resolves component-wise indeterminacy by restricting the admissible transformations from arbitrary diffeomorphisms to the affine class. Methodologically, arguing that the stochastic encoding inherent to VAEs obscures the structural residuals required for latent causal discovery, LANCA employs a deterministic Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE) coupled with a differentiable ANM Layer. This architecture transforms residual independence from a passive assumption into an explicit optimization objective.

Developing effective Reward Models (RMs) for this process faces significant methodological hurdles. Current data collection paradigms, reliant on in-prompt pairwise annotations, suffer from labeling noise. Concurrently, the architectural design of VLM-based RMs, particularly their output mechanisms, remains underexplored. Furthermore, RM is susceptible to reward hacking in post-training. To mitigate these limitations, we propose SoliReward, a systematic framework for video RM training. Our framework first sources high-quality, cost-efficient data via single-item binary annotations, then constructs preference pairs using a cross-prompt pairing strategy. Architecturally, we employ a Hierarchical Progressive Query Attention mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. Finally, we introduce a modified BT loss that explicitly accommodates win-tie scenarios.

Our experiments show this approach can yield better performance on reasoning tasks than training on human-annotated datasets. We hypothesize that two key factors explain this phenomenon: first, the distribution of synthetic data is inherently closer to the language model's own distribution, making it more amenable to learning. Second, these `incorrect' traces are often only partially flawed and contain valid reasoning steps from which the model can learn. To further test the first hypothesis, we use a language model to paraphrase human-annotated traces -- shifting their distribution closer to the model's own distribution -- and show that this improves performance. For the second hypothesis, we introduce increasingly flawed CoT traces and study to what extent models are tolerant to these flaws. We demonstrate our findings across various reasoning domains like math, algorithmic reasoning and code generation using MATH, GSM8K, Countdown and MBPP datasets on various language models ranging from 1.5B to 9B across Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models. Our study shows that curating datasets that are closer to the model's distribution is a critical aspect to consider.

While recent advancements in deep learning and foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising forecasting capabilities, they largely overlook the spatial dependencies inherent in city-scale traffic dynamics. In this paper, we propose TIDES (Traffic Intelligence with DeepSeek-Enhanced Spatial-temporal prediction), a novel LLM-based framework that captures spatial-temporal correlations for urban wireless traffic prediction. TIDES first identifies heterogeneous traffic patterns across regions through a clustering mechanism and trains personalized models for each region to balance generalization and specialization. To bridge the domain gap between numerical traffic data and language-based models, we introduce a prompt engineering scheme that embeds statistical traffic features as structured inputs. Furthermore, we design a DeepSeek module that enables spatial alignment via cross-domain attention, allowing the LLM to leverage information from spatially related regions. By fine-tuning only lightweight components while freezing core LLM layers, TIDES achieves efficient adaptation to domain-specific patterns without incurring excessive training overhead. Extensive experiments on real-world cellular traffic datasets demonstrate that TIDES significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and robustness. Our results indicate that integrating spatial awareness into LLM-based predictors is the key to unlocking scalable and intelligent network management in future 6G systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "TIDES\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eDeepSeek\u7684LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533a\u57df\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u57ce\u5e02\u65e0\u7ebf\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u57ce\u5e02\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6d41\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTIDES\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u673a\u5236\u8bc6\u522b\u533a\u57df\u5f02\u8d28\u6d41\u91cf\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d41\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u5165\uff1b3\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1DeepSeek\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u57df\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b4\uff09\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u51bb\u7ed3\u6838\u5fc3LLM\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8702\u7a9d\u6d41\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTIDES\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u4e2d\u662f\u89e3\u9501\u672a\u67656G\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u667a\u80fd\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

Using two pharmacologic logic compliance tasks, we benchmark LSP against zero shot prompting, chain of thought prompting, and concise prompting across three open weight models: Gemma 2, Mistral, and Llama 3. Across both tasks and all models, LSP consistently achieves the highest accuracy (0.83 to 0.89) and F1 score (0.83 to 0.89), substantially outperforming zero shot prompting (0.24 to 0.60), concise prompts (0.16 to 0.30), and chain of thought prompting (0.56 to 0.75).

Code available at: https://github.com/Rajeeb321123/Latent_sculpting_using_two_stage_method", "summary": "A fundamental limitation of supervised deep learning in high-dimensional tabular domains is \"Generalization Collapse\": models learn precise decision boundaries for known distributions but fail catastrophically when facing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. We hypothesize that this failure stems from the lack of topological constraints in the latent space, resulting in diffuse manifolds where novel anomalies remain statistically indistinguishable from benign data. To address this, we propose Latent Sculpting, a hierarchical two-stage representation learning framework. Stage 1 utilizes a hybrid 1D-CNN and Transformer Encoder trained with a novel Dual-Centroid Compactness Loss (DCCL) to actively \"sculpt\" benign traffic into a low-entropy, hyperspherical cluster. Unlike standard contrastive losses that rely on triplet mining, DCCL optimizes global cluster centroids to enforce absolute manifold density. Stage 2 conditions a Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) on this pre-structured manifold to learn an exact density estimate. We evaluate this methodology on the rigorous CIC-IDS-2017 benchmark, treating it as a proxy for complex, non-stationary data streams. Empirical results demonstrate that explicit manifold sculpting is a prerequisite for robust zero-shot generalization. While supervised baselines suffered catastrophic performance collapse on unseen distribution shifts (F1 approx 0.30) and the strongest unsupervised baseline achieved only 0.76, our framework achieved an F1-Score of 0.87 on strictly zero-shot anomalies.

I present a reinforcement learning framework that integrates a custom tennis simulation environment with a Dueling Double Deep Q-Network(DDQN) trained using curriculum learning. The environment models complete tennis scoring at the level of points, games, and sets, rally-level tactical decisions across ten discrete action categories, symmetric fatigue dynamics, and a continuous opponent skill parameter. The dueling architecture decomposes action-value estimation into state-value and advantage components, while double Q-learning reduces overestimation bias and improves training stability in this long-horizon stochastic domain. Curriculum learning progressively increases opponent difficulty from 0.40 to 0.50, enabling robust skill acquisition without the training collapse observed under fixed opponents. Across extensive evaluations, the trained agent achieves win rates between 98 and 100 percent against balanced opponents and maintains strong performance against more challenging opponents. Serve efficiency ranges from 63.0 to 67.5 percent, and return efficiency ranges from 52.8 to 57.1 percent. Ablation studies demonstrate that both the dueling architecture and curriculum learning are necessary for stable convergence, while a standard DQN baseline fails to learn effective policies.

Current approaches rely primarily on static validation methods that fail to catch behavior-level errors arising from interactive execution. In this paper, we propose Agent2World, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that achieves strong inference-time world-model generation and also serves as a data engine for supervised fine-tuning, by grounding generation in multi-agent feedback. Agent2World follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) A Deep Researcher agent performs knowledge synthesis by web searching to address specification gaps; (ii) A Model Developer agent implements executable world models; And (iii) a specialized Testing Team conducts adaptive unit testing and simulation-based validation. Agent2World demonstrates superior inference-time performance across three benchmarks spanning both Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and executable code representations, achieving consistent state-of-the-art results. Beyond inference, Testing Team serves as an interactive environment for the Model Developer, providing behavior-aware adaptive feedback that yields multi-turn training trajectories. The model fine-tuned on these trajectories substantially improves world-model generation, yielding an average relative gain of 30.95% over the same model before training.

This results in a potentially infinite number of applicable actions in a state. In this setting, off-the-shelf numeric heuristics that leverage the action structure are not feasible. In this paper, we identify a tractable subset of these problems--namely, controllable, simple numeric problems--and propose an optimistic compilation approach that transforms them into simple numeric tasks. To do so, we abstract control-dependent expressions into bounded constant effects and relaxed preconditions. The proposed compilation makes it possible to effectively use subgoaling heuristics to estimate goal distance in numeric planning problems involving control parameters. Our results demonstrate that this approach is an effective and computationally feasible way of applying traditional numeric heuristics to settings with an infinite number of possible actions, pushing the boundaries of the current state of the art.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u5e26\u6709\u63a7\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u6570\u5b57\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u9650\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4", "motivation": "\u5e26\u6709\u63a7\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u89c4\u5212\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65e0\u9650\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u63a7\u7b80\u5355\u6570\u5b57\u95ee\u9898\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e50\u89c2\u7f16\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u63a7\u5236\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3a\u6709\u754c\u5e38\u91cf\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u5bbd\u677e\u524d\u63d0\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u6570\u5b57\u4efb\u52a1", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u662f\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u9650\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u5b57\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u63a7\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u89c4\u5212\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8fb9\u754c"}}

Traditional condition monitoring approaches, often rule-based or purely physics-based, struggle with uncertainty, limited data availability, and the complexity of modern operating conditions. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) provide powerful tools to complement and extend these methods, enabling more accurate diagnostics, prognostics, and control. In this two-part series, we examine the role of Neural Networks (NNs) and their extensions in transformer condition monitoring and health management tasks. This first paper introduces the basic concepts of NNs, explores Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for condition monitoring using diverse data modalities, and discusses the integration of NN concepts within the Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm for decision-making and control.

Code available at https://github.com/lujiahao760/FrequencyRegularization", "summary": "Regularization techniques such as L2 regularization (Weight Decay) and Dropout are fundamental to training deep neural networks, yet their underlying physical mechanisms regarding feature frequency selection remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the Spectral Bias of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We introduce a Visual Diagnostic Framework to track the dynamic evolution of weight frequencies during training and propose a novel metric, the Spectral Suppression Ratio (SSR), to quantify the \"low-pass filtering\" intensity of different regularizers. By addressing the aliasing issue in small kernels (e.g., 3x3) through discrete radial profiling, our empirical results on ResNet-18 and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that L2 regularization suppresses high-frequency energy accumulation by over 3x compared to unregularized baselines. Furthermore, we reveal a critical Accuracy-Robustness Trade-off: while L2 models are sensitive to broadband Gaussian noise due to over-specialization in low frequencies, they exhibit superior robustness against high-frequency information loss (e.g., low resolution), outperforming baselines by >6% in blurred scenarios.

While this \"extrinsic maximization\" approach has rendered superhuman performance in closed, stationary fields, it produces agents that are fragile in open-ended, real-world environments. Standard agents lack internal autonomy: they struggle to explore without dense feedback, fail to adapt to distribution shifts (non-stationarity), and require extensive manual tuning of static hyperparameters. This paper proposes that the unaddressed factor in robust autonomy is a functional analog to biological emotion, serving as a high-level homeostatic control mechanism. We introduce Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals (EILS), a unified framework that replaces scattered optimization heuristics with a coherent, bio-inspired internal feedback engine. Unlike traditional methods that treat emotions as semantic labels, EILS models them as continuous, homeostatic appraisal signals such as Curiosity, Stress, and Confidence. We formalize these signals as vector-valued internal states derived from interaction history. These states dynamically modulate the agent's optimization landscape in real time: curiosity regulates entropy to prevent mode collapse, stress modulates plasticity to overcome inactivity, and confidence adapts trust regions to stabilize convergence. We hypothesize that this closed-loop homeostatic regulation can enable EILS agents to outperform standard baselines in terms of sample efficiency and non-stationary adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u60c5\u611f\u542f\u53d1\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08EILS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u751f\u7269\u60c5\u611f\u7c7b\u6bd4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7a33\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aAI\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08\u4ece\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u9759\u6001\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\"\u5916\u90e8\u6700\u5927\u5316\"\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c01\u95ed\u3001\u9759\u6001\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002\u6807\u51c6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u90e8\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff1a\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5bc6\u96c6\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff09\u3001\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u9759\u6001\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u60c5\u611f\u542f\u53d1\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08EILS\uff09\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u60c5\u611f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u7a33\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u3001\u538b\u529b\u3001\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4ece\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u503c\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u72b6\u6001\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\uff1a\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u8c03\u8282\u71b5\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u538b\u529b\u8c03\u8282\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u4e0d\u6d3b\u8dc3\uff0c\u4fe1\u5fc3\u9002\u5e94\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u5047\u8bbe\u8fd9\u79cd\u95ed\u73af\u7a33\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u80fd\u4f7fEILS\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "EILS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u5f15\u64ce\u66ff\u4ee3\u5206\u6563\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.

However, the major structure of transformer remains unchanged, ignoring one of its main intrinsic limitations, which is the same static value is used for every query in a head. Transformer itself tries to solve this problem by implementing multi-head attentions, yet the number of heads is limited by complexity. I propose a method to decide a value for each query dynamically, which could cut down all the redundant heads, keeping only one. Consequently, the following feed forward network could be cut down entirely, as each revised embedding has already fetched enough useful values far beyond the context. As a result, a single-head Dynamic Value Attention (DVA) is all you need in a transformer.

In this work, we identify a class of attention sinks, which we term secondary sinks, that differ fundamentally from the sinks studied in prior works, which we term primary sinks. While prior works have identified that tokens other than BOS can sometimes become sinks, they were found to exhibit properties analogous to the BOS token. Specifically, they emerge at the same layer, persist throughout the network and draw a large amount of attention mass. Whereas, we find the existence of secondary sinks that arise primarily in middle layers and can persist for a variable number of layers, and draw a smaller, but still significant, amount of attention mass. Through extensive experiments across 11 model families, we analyze where these secondary sinks appear, their properties, how they are formed, and their impact on the attention mechanism. Specifically, we show that: (1) these sinks are formed by specific middle-layer MLP modules; these MLPs map token representations to vectors that align with the direction of the primary sink of that layer. (2) The $\\ell_2$-norm of these vectors determines the sink score of the secondary sink, and also the number of layers it lasts for, thereby leading to different impacts on the attention mechanisms accordingly. (3) The primary sink weakens in middle layers, coinciding with the emergence of secondary sinks. We observe that in larger-scale models, the location and lifetime of the sinks, together referred to as sink levels, appear in a more deterministic and frequent manner. Specifically, we identify three sink levels in QwQ-32B and six levels in Qwen3-14B.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6c47\u70b9\u2014\u2014\u6b21\u7ea7\u6c47\u70b9\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e4b\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6c47\u70b9\uff08\u5982BOS\u6807\u8bb0\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u6b21\u7ea7\u6c47\u70b9\u4e3b\u8981\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u53d8\uff0c\u5438\u5f15\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8d28\u91cf\u8f83\u5c0f\u4f46\u4ecd\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6c47\u70b9\uff08\u5982BOS\u6807\u8bb0\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6c47\u70b9\u63a5\u6536\u4e0d\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u9ad8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f46\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u7c7b\u6027\u8d28\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6b21\u7ea7\u6c47\u70b9\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u7279\u6027\u3001\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf911\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6b21\u7ea7\u6c47\u70b9\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u5f62\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u8bc6\u522b\u6b21\u7ea7\u6c47\u70b9\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff08\u7279\u5b9a\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42MLP\u6a21\u5757\uff09\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u5176\u5411\u91cf\u8303\u6570\u4e0e\u6c47\u70b9\u5206\u6570\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e3b\u8981\u6c47\u70b9\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7684\u51cf\u5f31\u73b0\u8c61\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a(1) \u6b21\u7ea7\u6c47\u70b9\u7531\u7279\u5b9a\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42MLP\u6a21\u5757\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9bMLP\u5c06\u6807\u8bb0\u8868\u793a\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e0e\u8be5\u5c42\u4e3b\u8981\u6c47\u70b9\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5411\u91cf\uff1b(2) \u8fd9\u4e9b\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u2113\u2082\u8303\u6570\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u6b21\u7ea7\u6c47\u70b9\u7684\u5206\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b(3) \u4e3b\u8981\u6c47\u70b9\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u4e0e\u6b21\u7ea7\u6c47\u70b9\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u91cd\u5408\u3002\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6c47\u70b9\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u7edf\u79f0\u4e3a\u6c47\u70b9\u5c42\u7ea7\uff09\u4ee5\u66f4\u786e\u5b9a\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u5982\u5728QwQ-32B\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa3\u4e2a\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u5728Qwen3-14B\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa6\u4e2a\u5c42\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u6b21\u7ea7\u6c47\u70b9\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u4e3b\u8981\u6c47\u70b9\u7684\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u6b21\u7ea7\u6c47\u70b9\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6c47\u70b9\u5c42\u7ea7\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

This stems from a fundamental computational bottleneck: ab initio methods offer quantum accuracy but are restricted to small spatiotemporal scales (< 500 atoms, picoseconds), while empirical force fields lack the reactive fidelity required for complex combustion environments. Herein, we bridge this gap by employing a \"human-in-the-loop\" closed-loop framework where self-auditing AI Agents validate the evolution of a machine learning potential (MLP). By acting as scientific sentinels that visualize hidden model artifacts for human decision-making, this collaborative cycle ensures quantum mechanical accuracy while exhibiting near-linear scalability to million-atom systems and accessing nanosecond timescales (energy RMSE: 1.2 meV/atom, force RMSE: 0.126 eV/Angstrom). Strikingly, our simulations reveal a temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation mechanism: at moderate temperatures, the oxide shell acts as a dynamic \"gatekeeper,\" regulating oxidation through a \"breathing mode\" of transient nanochannels; above a critical threshold, a \"rupture mode\" unleashes catastrophic shell failure and explosive combustion. Importantly, we resolve a decades-old controversy by demonstrating that aluminum cation outward diffusion, rather than oxygen transport, dominates mass transfer across all temperature regimes, with diffusion coefficients consistently exceeding those of oxygen by 2-3 orders of magnitude. These discoveries establish a unified atomic-scale framework for energetic nanomaterial design, enabling the precision engineering of ignition sensitivity and energy release rates through intelligent computational design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\"\u4eba\u5728\u56de\u8def\"\u7684AI\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u52bf\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u91cf\u5b50\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5230\u767e\u4e07\u539f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u94dd\u7eb3\u7c73\u9897\u7c92\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u6c27\u5316\u673a\u5236\u548c\u94dd\u9633\u79bb\u5b50\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u94dd\u7eb3\u7c73\u9897\u7c92\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u80fd\u56fa\u4f53\u71c3\u6599\uff0c\u5176\u4ece\u949d\u5316\u9897\u7c92\u5230\u7206\u70b8\u53cd\u5e94\u7269\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u74f6\u9888\uff1a\u4ece\u5934\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u529b\u573a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u590d\u6742\u71c3\u70e7\u73af\u5883\u6240\u9700\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\"\u4eba\u5728\u56de\u8def\"\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684AI\u4ee3\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u52bf\u80fd\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002AI\u4ee3\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u54e8\u5175\uff0c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f2a\u5f71\u4f9b\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u767e\u4e07\u539f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u7eb3\u79d2\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u62df\uff08\u80fd\u91cfRMSE\uff1a1.2 meV/\u539f\u5b50\uff0c\u529bRMSE\uff1a0.126 eV/\u00c5\uff09\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u6c27\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4e2d\u7b49\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u58f3\u5c42\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\"\u5b88\u95e8\u5458\"\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77ac\u6001\u7eb3\u7c73\u901a\u9053\u7684\"\u547c\u5438\u6a21\u5f0f\"\u8c03\u63a7\u6c27\u5316\uff1b\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e34\u754c\u9608\u503c\u65f6\uff0c\"\u7834\u88c2\u6a21\u5f0f\"\u5bfc\u81f4\u58f3\u5c42\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5931\u6548\u548c\u7206\u70b8\u6027\u71c3\u70e7\u3002\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u5341\u5e74\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u94dd\u9633\u79bb\u5b50\u5411\u5916\u6269\u6563\uff08\u800c\u975e\u6c27\u4f20\u8f93\uff09\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6e29\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8d28\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u7cfb\u6570\u6bd4\u6c27\u9ad82-3\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u80fd\u7eb3\u7c73\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u70b9\u706b\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u91ca\u653e\u901f\u7387\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5de5\u7a0b\u3002"}}

We propose an interpretable and adaptive framework for semi-supervised node classification based on explicit combinatorial inference rather than deep message passing. Our method assigns labels using a confidence-ordered greedy procedure driven by an additive scoring function that integrates class priors, neighborhood statistics, feature similarity, and training-derived label-label compatibility. A small set of transparent hyperparameters controls the relative influence of these components, enabling smooth adaptation between homophilic and heterophilic regimes.\n  We further introduce a validation-gated hybrid strategy in which combinatorial predictions are optionally injected as priors into a lightweight neural model. Hybrid refinement is applied only when it improves validation performance, preserving interpretability when neuralization is unnecessary. All adaptation signals are computed strictly from training data, ensuring a leakage-free evaluation protocol. Experiments on heterophilic and transitional benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance with modern GNNs while offering advantages in interpretability, tunability, and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u663e\u5f0f\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u800c\u975e\u6df1\u5ea6\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u914d\u56fe\u548c\u8fc7\u6e21\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0eGNNs\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u8c03\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u540c\u6027\u914d\u56fe\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f02\u914d\u56fe\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u76f8\u90bb\u8282\u70b9\u7ecf\u5e38\u5c5e\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u914d\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u914d\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u6574\u5408\u7c7b\u522b\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u90bb\u57df\u7edf\u8ba1\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95e8\u63a7\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u7ec4\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u6ce8\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u5f53\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u65f6\u624d\u5e94\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u7ec6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f02\u914d\u56fe\u548c\u8fc7\u6e21\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u76f8\u6bd4\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u8c03\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u663e\u5f0f\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5e73\u6ed1\u9002\u5e94\u540c\u914d\u548c\u5f02\u914d\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95e8\u63a7\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fe1\u53f7\u90fd\u4e25\u683c\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u65e0\u6cc4\u6f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

However, current foundation models ignore three other important components of state-of-the-art predictive coding models: tight integration of actions with generative models, hierarchical compositional structure, and episodic memory. We propose that to achieve safe, interpretable, energy-efficient, and human-like AI, foundation models should integrate actions, at multiple scales of abstraction, with a compositional generative architecture and episodic memory. We present recent evidence from neuroscience and cognitive science on the importance of each of these components. We describe how the addition of these missing components to foundation models could help address some of their current deficiencies: hallucinations and superficial understanding of concepts due to lack of grounding, a missing sense of agency/responsibility due to lack of control, threats to safety and trustworthiness due to lack of interpretability, and energy inefficiency. We compare our proposal to current trends, such as adding chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to foundation models, and discuss new ways of augmenting these models with brain-inspired components. We conclude by arguing that a rekindling of the historically fruitful exchange of ideas between brain science and AI will help pave the way towards safe and interpretable human-centered AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9884\u6d4b\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u884c\u52a8\u6574\u5408\u3001\u5c42\u6b21\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u6574\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4ee5\u521b\u5efa\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u8282\u80fd\u4e14\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\u635f\u5931\u8fd9\u4e00\u7b80\u5355\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u884c\u52a8\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u6574\u5408\u3001\u5c42\u6b21\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u5931\u9650\u5236\u4e86AI\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u7c7b\u4eba\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u884c\u52a8\u6574\u5408\uff08\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\uff09\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8fd9\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6574\u5408\u5230\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u501f\u9274\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u7840\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u7406\u89e3\u80a4\u6d45\u3001\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a7\u5236\u800c\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u611f/\u8d23\u4efb\u611f\u3001\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u80fd\u6548\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u8d8b\u52bf\uff08\u5982\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff09\u4e0e\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u6fc0\u53d1\u8111\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0eAI\u4e4b\u95f4\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u5bcc\u6709\u6210\u679c\u7684\u601d\u60f3\u4ea4\u6d41\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8fd9\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

We introduce M\u00fcntz-Sz\u00e1sz Networks (MSN), a novel architecture that replaces fixed smooth activations with learnable fractional power bases grounded in classical approximation theory. Each MSN edge computes $\u03c6(x) = \\sum_k a_k |x|^{\u03bc_k} + \\sum_k b_k \\mathrm{sign}(x)|x|^{\u03bb_k}$, where the exponents $\\{\u03bc_k, \u03bb_k\\}$ are learned alongside the coefficients. We prove that MSN inherits universal approximation from the M\u00fcntz-Sz\u00e1sz theorem and establish novel approximation rates: for functions of the form $|x|^\u03b1$, MSN achieves error $\\mathcal{O}(|\u03bc- \u03b1|^2)$ with a single learned exponent, whereas standard MLPs require $\\mathcal{O}(\u03b5^{-1/\u03b1})$ neurons for comparable accuracy. On supervised regression with singular target functions, MSN achieves 5-8x lower error than MLPs with 10x fewer parameters. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a particularly demanding application for singular function approximation; on PINN benchmarks including a singular ODE and stiff boundary-layer problems, MSN achieves 3-6x improvement while learning interpretable exponents that match the known solution structure.

It has the potential to facilitate real-time network management and optimization functions, including self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex environments. This paper proposes SANet, a novel semantic-aware AgentNet architecture for wireless networks that can infer the semantic goal of the user and automatically assign agents associated with different layers of the network to fulfill the inferred goal. Motivated by the fact that AgentNet is a decentralized framework in which collaborating agents may generally have different and even conflicting objectives, we formulate the decentralized optimization of SANet as a multi-agent multi-objective problem, and focus on finding the Pareto-optimal solution for agents with distinct and potentially conflicting objectives. We propose three novel metrics for evaluating SANet. Furthermore, we develop a model partition and sharing (MoPS) framework in which large models, e.g., deep learning models, of different agents can be partitioned into shared and agent-specific parts that are jointly constructed and deployed according to agents' local computational resources. Two decentralized optimization algorithms are proposed. We derive theoretical bounds and prove that there exists a three-way tradeoff among optimization, generalization, and conflicting errors. We develop an open-source RAN and core network-based hardware prototype that implements agents to interact with three different layers of the network. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieved performance gains of up to 14.61% while requiring only 44.37% of FLOPs required by state-of-the-art algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSANet\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5AgentNet\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u8bed\u4e49\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0e\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u533a\u5171\u4eab\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u539f\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "AgentNet\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578bAI\u539f\u751f\u7f51\u7edc\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u534f\u4f5c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u5e38\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u751a\u81f3\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSANet\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5AgentNet\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u533a\u5171\u4eab\uff08MoPS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7279\u5b9a\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eRAN\u548c\u6838\u5fc3\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u539f\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe14.61%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u9700\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd544.37%\u7684FLOPs\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u8bef\u5dee\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e09\u65b9\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "SANet\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86AgentNet\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u539f\u751f\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This is the accepted author manuscript", "summary": "Modern networks generate vast, heterogeneous traffic that must be continuously analyzed for security and performance. Traditional network traffic analysis systems, whether rule-based or machine learning-driven, often suffer from high false positives and lack interpretability, limiting analyst trust. In this paper, we present ReGAIN, a multi-stage framework that combines traffic summarization, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning for transparent and accurate network traffic analysis. ReGAIN creates natural-language summaries from network traffic, embeds them into a multi-collection vector database, and utilizes a hierarchical retrieval pipeline to ground LLM responses with evidence citations. The pipeline features metadata-based filtering, MMR sampling, a two-stage cross-encoder reranking mechanism, and an abstention mechanism to reduce hallucinations and ensure grounded reasoning.

However, existing methods suffer from limited generalization capability: unimodal approaches are constrained by data sparsity and inherent biases, while multi-modal methods struggle to effectively capture mobility dynamics caused by the semantic gap between static multi-modal representation and spatial-temporal dynamics. Therefore, we leverage multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge to characterize mobility dynamics for the location recommendation task, dubbed as \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{M}odal \\textbf{Mob}ility (\\textbf{M}$^3$\\textbf{ob}). First, we construct a unified spatial-temporal relational graph (STRG) for multi-modal representation, by leveraging the functional semantics and spatial-temporal knowledge captured by the large language models (LLMs)-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG). Second, we design a gating mechanism to fuse spatial-temporal graph representations of different modalities, and propose an STKG-guided cross-modal alignment to inject spatial-temporal dynamic knowledge into the static image modality. Extensive experiments on six public datasets show that our proposed method not only achieves consistent improvements in normal scenarios but also exhibits significant generalization ability in abnormal scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "M\u00b3ob\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u7a7a\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u65f6\u7a7a\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u79fb\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff1a\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u56fa\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u9759\u6001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9e3f\u6c9f", "method": "1) \u5229\u7528LLM\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u65f6\u7a7a\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\uff1b2) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51faSTKG\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u6001", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u6b63\u5e38\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4e5f\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "M\u00b3ob\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u7a7a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6709\u6548\u8868\u5f81\u79fb\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

This raises the need for compact yet capable VLMs that can efficiently learn from powerful large teachers. However, distilling knowledge from a large teacher to a small student remains challenging due to their large size gap: the student often fails to reproduce the teacher's complex, high-dimensional representations, leading to unstable learning and degraded performance. To address this, we propose Masters (Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student), a mask-progressive reinforcement learning (RL) distillation framework. Masters first masks non-dominant weights of the teacher to reduce unnecessary complexity, then progressively restores the teacher by gradually increasing its capacity during training. This strategy allows the student to learn richer representations from the teacher in a smooth and stable manner. To further refine knowledge transfer, Masters integrates an offline RL stage with two complementary rewards: an accuracy reward that measures the correctness of the generated responses, and a distillation reward that quantifies the ease of transferring responses from teacher to student. Unlike online think-answer RL paradigms that are computationally expensive and generate lengthy responses, our offline RL leverages pre-generated responses from masked teachers. These provide rich yet efficient guidance, enabling students to achieve strong performance without requiring the think-answer process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMasters\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5c0f\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5dee\u8ddd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u56f0\u96be\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u4f46\u4f53\u79ef\u5e9e\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u79fb\u52a8\u6216\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7d27\u51d1\u4f46\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u7684VLM\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u6559\u5e08\u5230\u5c0f\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u9762\u4e34\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5dee\u8ddd\u5927\u3001\u5b66\u751f\u96be\u4ee5\u590d\u73b0\u6559\u5e08\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7b49\u6311\u6218", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMasters\uff08Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u9996\u5148\u63a9\u7801\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u975e\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6743\u91cd\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u52a0\u6559\u5e08\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u6e10\u8fdb\u6062\u590d\u6559\u5e08\u80fd\u529b\uff1b3\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u5956\u52b1\uff1a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5956\u52b1\uff08\u8861\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff09\u548c\u84b8\u998f\u5956\u52b1\uff08\u91cf\u5316\u4ece\u6559\u5e08\u5230\u5b66\u751f\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u96be\u6613\u5ea6\uff09\uff1b4\uff09\u5229\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u6559\u5e08\u9884\u751f\u6210\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u6307\u5bfc", "result": "\u5b66\u751f\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u5e73\u6ed1\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ece\u6559\u5e08\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u7ebf\u601d\u8003-\u56de\u7b54\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8", "conclusion": "Masters\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u6e10\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u6559\u5e08\u4e0e\u5c0f\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u4e3a\u90e8\u7f72\u7d27\u51d1\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848"}}

By designing role-playing agents and a GNN-based supervised interaction module, we reformulate startup financing prediction as a group decision-making task, capturing both enterprise fundamentals and the behavioral dynamics of potential investor networks. Each agent embodies an investor with unique traits and preferences, enabling heterogeneous evaluation and realistic information exchange through a graph-structured co-investment network. Using real-world data from PitchBook and under strict data leakage controls, we show that SimVC-CAS significantly improves predictive accuracy while providing interpretable, multiperspective reasoning, for example, approximately 25% relative improvement with respect to average precision@10.

Once a model reaches high accuracy, its explanation is often assumed to be correct and trustworthy. However, this assumption raises an overlooked question: when two models achieve high accuracy, do they rely on the same internal logic, or do they reach the same outcome via different -- and potentially competing -- mechanisms? We introduce EvoXplain, a diagnostic framework that measures the stability of model explanations across repeated training. Rather than analysing a single trained model, EvoXplain treats explanations as samples drawn from the stochastic optimisation process itself -- without aggregating predictions or constructing ensembles -- and examines whether these samples form a single coherent explanation or separate into multiple, distinct explanatory modes. We evaluate EvoXplain on the Breast Cancer and COMPAS datasets using two widely deployed model classes: Logistic Regression and Random Forests. Although all models achieve high predictive accuracy, their explanations frequently exhibit clear multimodality. Even models commonly assumed to be stable, such as Logistic Regression, can produce multiple well-separated explanatory basins under repeated training on the same data split.

The proposed framework is performed using multiple experimental datasets compiled from peer-reviewed literature and in-house experiments and evaluated across powder-fed, wire-fed, and hybrid wire-powder L-DED processes. Results show that both MAML and Reptile achieve accurate bead height predictions on unseen target tasks using as few as three to nine training examples, consistently outperforming conventional feedforward neural networks trained under comparable data constraints.

Screening high-risk individuals with annual low-dose CT (LDCT) can support earlier detection and reduce deaths, but widespread implementation may strain the already limited radiology workforce. AI models have shown potential in estimating lung cancer risk from LDCT scans. However, high-risk populations for lung cancer are diverse, and these models' performance across demographic groups remains an open question. In this study, we drew on the considerations on confounding factors and ethically significant biases outlined in the JustEFAB framework to evaluate potential performance disparities and fairness in two deep learning risk estimation models for lung cancer screening: the Sybil lung cancer risk model and the Venkadesh21 nodule risk estimator. We also examined disparities in the PanCan2b logistic regression model recommended in the British Thoracic Society nodule management guideline. Both deep learning models were trained on data from the US-based National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), and assessed on a held-out NLST validation set. We evaluated AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity across demographic subgroups, and explored potential confounding from clinical risk factors. We observed a statistically significant AUROC difference in Sybil's performance between women (0.88, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.90) and men (0.81, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.84, p < .001).

Travel planning provides a natural and high-impact testbed for these capabilities, as it requires multi-step reasoning, iterative preference elicitation through interaction, and calls to external tools under evolving constraints. Prior work has studied LLMs on travel-planning tasks, but existing settings are limited in domain coverage and multi-turn interaction. As a result, they cannot support dynamic user-agent interaction and therefore fail to comprehensively assess agent capabilities. In this paper, we introduce TravelBench, a real-world travel-planning benchmark featuring multi-turn interaction and tool use. We collect user requests from real-world scenarios and construct three subsets-multi-turn, single-turn, and unsolvable-to evaluate different aspects of agent performance. For stable and reproducible evaluation, we build a controlled sandbox environment with 10 travel-domain tools, providing deterministic tool outputs for reliable reasoning. We evaluate multiple LLMs on TravelBench and conduct an analysis of their behaviors and performance.

Our dataset comprises oat samples collected in Ireland, containing a mix of environmental, agronomic, and geographical predictors. Five modelling approaches were evaluated: a baseline multilayer perceptron (MLP), an MLP with pre-training, and three transfer learning models; TabPFN, TabNet, and FT-Transformer. Model performance was evaluated using regression (RMSE, $R^2$) and classification (AUC, F1) metrics, with results reported per toxin and on average. Additionally, permutation-based variable importance analysis was conducted to identify the most influential predictors across both prediction tasks.

The framework identifies reflection as the key mechanism that enables agents to adapt through interaction without back propagation or model fine tuning, thereby relaxing the conventional separation between training and deployment.To formalise this process, we introduce the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, which models reflective learning as a two stage read write interaction with episodic memory. Writing stores interaction outcomes and corresponds to policy evaluation, while reading retrieves relevant past cases and corresponds to policy improvement. We show that this process induces an equivalent Markov decision process over augmented state memory representations, allowing the use of classical tools from dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. We further instantiate the framework using entropy regularised policy iteration and establish convergence guarantees. As episodic memory grows and achieves sufficient coverage of the state space, the resulting policy converges to the optimal solution. This work provides a principled foundation for memory augmented and retrieval based language model agents capable of continual adaptation without parameter updates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff08\u5982\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u624d\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fdb\u884c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u5316\u53cd\u601d\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u53cd\u601d\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e0e\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfb\u5199\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1a\u5199\u5165\u5b58\u50a8\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ed3\u679c\uff08\u5bf9\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\uff0c\u8bfb\u53d6\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u8fc7\u53bb\u6848\u4f8b\uff08\u5bf9\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u72b6\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7b49\u6548\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1a\u968f\u7740\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u957f\u5e76\u5145\u5206\u8986\u76d6\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6240\u5f97\u7b56\u7565\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u66f4\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u3002"}}

However, existing techniques, such as verbalized confidence and multi-generation methods, are often either poorly calibrated or computationally expensive. We introduce linear probes trained with a Brier score-based loss to provide calibrated uncertainty estimates from reasoning judges' hidden states, requiring no additional model training. We evaluate our approach on both objective tasks (reasoning, mathematics, factuality, coding) and subjective human preference judgments. Our results demonstrate that probes achieve superior calibration compared to existing methods with $\\approx10$x computational savings, generalize robustly to unseen evaluation domains, and deliver higher accuracy on high-confidence predictions. However, probes produce conservative estimates that underperform on easier datasets but may benefit safety-critical deployments prioritizing low false-positive rates. Overall, our work demonstrates that interpretability-based uncertainty estimation provides a practical and scalable plug-and-play solution for LLM judges in production.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eBrier\u5206\u6570\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u4eceLLM\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u83b7\u53d6\u826f\u597d\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u4e8e\u751f\u4ea7\u90e8\u7f72\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5982\u8bed\u8a00\u5316\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u6821\u51c6\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eBrier\u5206\u6570\u635f\u5931\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u4ece\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u63a2\u9488\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5ba2\u89c2\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u548c\u4e3b\u89c2\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5224\u65ad\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u7701\u7ea610\u500d\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u57df\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e3aLLM\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4fdd\u5b88\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

We propose a Segmented Allocation with Momentum-Adjusted Utility for Multi-agent Portfolio Management via Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (SAMP-HDRL). The framework first applies dynamic asset grouping to partition the market into high-quality and ordinary subsets. An upper-level agent extracts global market signals, while lower-level agents perform intra-group allocation under mask constraints. A utility-based capital allocation mechanism integrates risky and risk-free assets, ensuring coherent coordination between global and local decisions. backtests across three market regimes (2019--2021) demonstrate that SAMP-HDRL consistently outperforms nine traditional baselines and nine DRL benchmarks under volatile and oscillating conditions. Compared with the strongest baseline, our method achieves at least 5\\% higher Return, 5\\% higher Sharpe ratio, 5\\% higher Sortino ratio, and 2\\% higher Omega ratio, with substantially larger gains observed in turbulent markets. Ablation studies confirm that upper--lower coordination, dynamic clustering, and capital allocation are indispensable to robustness. SHAP-based interpretability further reveals a complementary ``diversified + concentrated'' mechanism across agents, providing transparent insights into decision-making.

Intended for submission to the ICLR 2025 Workshop on \"Optimisation for Representation Learning\"", "summary": "A systematic mismatch exists between mathematically ideal and effective activation updates during gradient descent. As intended, parameters update in their direction of steepest descent. However, activations are argued to constitute a more directly impactful quantity to prioritise in optimisation, as they are closer to the loss in the computational graph and carry sample-dependent information through the network. Yet their propagated updates do not take the optimal steepest-descent step. These quantities exhibit non-ideal sample-wise scaling across affine, convolutional, and attention layers. Solutions to correct for this are trivial and, entirely incidentally, derive normalisation from first principles despite motivational independence. Consequently, such considerations offer a fresh and conceptual reframe of normalisation's action, with auxiliary experiments bolstering this mechanistically. Moreover, this analysis makes clear a second possibility: a solution that is functionally distinct from modern normalisations, without scale-invariance, yet remains empirically successful, outperforming conventional normalisers across several tests. This is presented as an alternative to the affine map. This generalises to convolution via a new functional form, \"PatchNorm\", a compositionally inseparable normaliser. Together, these provide an alternative mechanistic framework that adds to, and counters some of, the discussion of normalisation. Further, it is argued that normalisers are better decomposed into activation-function-like maps with parameterised scaling, thereby aiding the prioritisation of representations during optimisation. Overall, this constitutes a theoretical-principled approach that yields several new functions that are empirically validated and raises questions about the affine + nonlinear approach to model creation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6fc0\u6d3b\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4f20\u7edf\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4f46\u65e0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u5377\u79ef\u4e13\u7528\u7684PatchNorm\u3002", "motivation": "\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u56fe\u4e2d\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e14\u643a\u5e26\u6837\u672c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4e2d\u5176\u66f4\u65b0\u5e76\u975e\u6700\u4f18\u6700\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4fc3\u4f7f\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6fc0\u6d3b\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1a1\uff09\u529f\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f46\u65e0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff1b2\uff09\u9488\u5bf9\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\u7684\u65b0\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\"PatchNorm\"\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u8d28\u7591\u4e86\"\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u6362+\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\"\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u51fa\u53d1\u4e3a\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u8868\u793a\u3002"}}

However, scientific intelligence encompasses a broad spectrum of abilities ranging from understanding fundamental knowledge to conducting creative discovery, and existing benchmarks remain fragmented. Most focus on narrow tasks and fail to reflect the hierarchical and multi-disciplinary nature of real scientific inquiry. We introduce \\textbf{HiSciBench}, a hierarchical benchmark designed to evaluate foundation models across five levels that mirror the complete scientific workflow: \\textit{Scientific Literacy} (L1), \\textit{Literature Parsing} (L2), \\textit{Literature-based Question Answering} (L3), \\textit{Literature Review Generation} (L4), and \\textit{Scientific Discovery} (L5). HiSciBench contains 8,735 carefully curated instances spanning six major scientific disciplines, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and astronomy, and supports multimodal inputs including text, equations, figures, and tables, as well as cross-lingual evaluation. Unlike prior benchmarks that assess isolated abilities, HiSciBench provides an integrated, dependency-aware framework that enables detailed diagnosis of model capabilities across different stages of scientific reasoning.

Traditional approaches rely on computational fluid dynamics or empirical correlations, while data-driven methods require extensive real flight data that is expensive and time-consuming to collect. We present a simulation-based amortized inference approach that trains a neural network on synthetic flight data generated from a physics simulator, then applies the learned model to real flights without any fine-tuning. Our method learns to invert the forward physics model, directly predicting drag coefficient and thrust correction factor from a single apogee measurement combined with motor and configuration features. In this proof-of-concept study, we train on 10,000 synthetic flights and evaluate on 8 real flights, achieving a mean absolute error of 12.3 m in apogee prediction - demonstrating promising sim-to-real transfer with zero real training examples. Analysis reveals a systematic positive bias in predictions, providing quantitative insight into the gap between idealized physics and real-world flight conditions. We additionally compare against OpenRocket baseline predictions, showing that our learned approach reduces apogee prediction error.

A key limitation of existing approaches like Ultra is their reliance on a single relational transformation (e.g., element-wise multiplication) in message passing, which can constrain expressiveness and fail to capture diverse relational and structural patterns exhibited on diverse graphs. In this paper, we propose Gamma, a novel foundation model that introduces multi-head geometric attention to knowledge graph reasoning. Gamma replaces the single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones, including real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations, each designed to model different relational structures. A relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism then adaptively fuses them at link level via a lightweight gating with entropy regularization, allowing the model to robustly emphasize the most appropriate relational bias for each triple pattern. We present a full formalization of these algebraic message functions and discuss how their combination increases expressiveness beyond any single space. Comprehensive experiments on 56 diverse knowledge graphs demonstrate that Gamma consistently outperforms Ultra in zero-shot inductive link prediction, with a 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on the inductive benchmarks and a 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks, highlighting benefits from complementary geometric representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Gamma\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5934\u51e0\u4f55\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u4ee3\u6570\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u5b9e\u6570\u3001\u590d\u6570\u3001\u5206\u88c2\u590d\u6570\u3001\u5bf9\u5076\u6570\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f52\u7eb3\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5Ultra\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Ultra\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u5982\u9010\u5143\u7d20\u4e58\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6837\u5316\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGamma\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5934\u51e0\u4f55\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u79cd\u5e76\u884c\u4ee3\u6570\u53d8\u6362\uff1a\u5b9e\u6570\u3001\u590d\u6570\u3001\u5206\u88c2\u590d\u6570\u548c\u5bf9\u5076\u6570\u53d8\u6362\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u7cfb\u6761\u4ef6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u94fe\u63a5\u7ea7\u522b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u95e8\u63a7\u548c\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u5f3a\u8c03\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6a21\u5f0f\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u572856\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGamma\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f52\u7eb3\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8eUltra\uff0c\u5728\u5f52\u7eb3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u5012\u6570\u6392\u540d\u63d0\u53475.5%\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u63d0\u53474.4%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e92\u8865\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "Gamma\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5934\u51e0\u4f55\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, traditional methods overlook the role of temporal semantic exploration in HMS. This paper explores the use of temporal vision semantics (TVS) derived from human motion sequences, leveraging the image-to-text capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to enhance subspace clustering performance. The core idea is to extract textual motion information from consecutive frames via LLM and incorporate this learned information into the subspace clustering framework. The primary challenge lies in learning TVS from human motion sequences using LLM and integrating this information into subspace clustering. To address this, we determine whether consecutive frames depict the same motion by querying the LLM and subsequently learn temporal neighboring information based on its response. We then develop a TVS-integrated subspace clustering approach, incorporating subspace embedding with a temporal regularizer that induces each frame to share similar subspace embeddings with its temporal neighbors. Additionally, segmentation is performed based on subspace embedding with a temporal constraint that induces the grouping of each frame with its temporal neighbors. We also introduce a feedback-enabled framework that continuously optimizes subspace embedding based on the segmentation output.

Existing approaches, including large vision language models (LVLMs) and deep multimodal fusion methods, often fall short due to limited reasoning and shallow evidence utilization. A key bottleneck is the lack of dedicated datasets that provide complete real-world multimodal misinformation instances accompanied by annotated reasoning processes and verifiable evidence. To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the synergy between RW-Post and AgentFact substantially improves both the accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RW-Post\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cAgentFact\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u4f20\u64ad\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u7531\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u5229\u7528\u6d45\u5c42\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5305\u542b\u5b8c\u6574\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3001\u5e26\u6ce8\u91ca\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165RW-Post\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1a\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u58f0\u660e\u4e0e\u5176\u539f\u59cb\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e16\u5b50\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u63d0\u53d6\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ece\u4eba\u5de5\u64b0\u5199\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u6587\u7ae0\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u8be6\u7ec6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u660e\u786e\u94fe\u63a5\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u30022. \u63d0\u51faAgentFact\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u7b56\u7565\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u6790\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5728\u8bc1\u636e\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u8bc1\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRW-Post\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cAgentFact\u6846\u67b6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RW-Post\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cAgentFact\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While prior deep learning frameworks have integrated multimodal embeddings into biomedical knowledge graphs (BKGs) and further improved these representations through graph neural network message-passing paradigms, these models have been applied to tasks such as link prediction and binary drug-disease association, rather than the task of gene perturbation, which may unveil more about mechanistic transcriptomic effects. To address this gap, we construct a merged biomedical graph that integrates (i) PrimeKG++, an augmentation of PrimeKG containing semantically rich embeddings for nodes with (ii) LINCS L1000 drug and cell line nodes, initialized with multimodal embeddings from foundation models such as MolFormerXL and BioBERT. Using this heterogeneous graph, we train a graph attention network (GAT) with a downstream prediction head that learns the delta expression profile of over 978 landmark genes for a given drug-cell pair. Our results show that our framework outperforms MLP baselines for differentially expressed genes (DEG) -- which predict the delta expression given a concatenated embedding of drug features, target features, and baseline cell expression -- under the scaffold and random splits.

This is especially problematic in K--12 settings, which the EU AI Act classifies as high-risk domain requiring responsible design. Motivated by these concerns, this study synthesises evidence on limitations of LLM-based tutors and empirically investigates one critical issue: the accuracy, reliability, and temporal coherence of assessing learners' evolving knowledge over time. We compare a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model with a widely used LLM, evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned, using a large open-access dataset. Results show that DKT achieves the highest discrimination performance (AUC = 0.83) on next-step correctness prediction and consistently outperforms the LLM across settings. Although fine-tuning improves the LLM's AUC by approximately 8\\% over the zero-shot baseline, it remains 6\\% below DKT and produces higher early-sequence errors, where incorrect predictions are most harmful for adaptive support. Temporal analyses further reveal that DKT maintains stable, directionally correct mastery updates, whereas LLM variants exhibit substantial temporal weaknesses, including inconsistent and wrong-direction updates. These limitations persist despite the fine-tuned LLM requiring nearly 198 hours of high-compute training, far exceeding the computational demands of DKT. Our qualitative analysis of multi-skill mastery estimation further shows that, even after fine-tuning, the LLM produced inconsistent mastery trajectories, while DKT maintained smooth and coherent updates. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs alone are unlikely to match the effectiveness of established intelligent tutoring systems, and that responsible tutoring requires hybrid frameworks that incorporate learner modelling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728K-12\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eLLM\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\uff0cLLM\u4ecd\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u4f20\u7edf\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9K-12\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8bef\u89e3\u2014\u2014\u8ba4\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5efa\u6a21\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6559\u5b66\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6b27\u76dfAI\u6cd5\u6848\u5c06K-12\u6559\u80b2\u5217\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5730\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6559\u80b2AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u5f00\u653e\u8bbf\u95ee\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6df1\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684LLM\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u77e5\u8bc6\u6f14\u53d8\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "DKT\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad8\u533a\u5206\u6027\u80fd\uff08AUC=0.83\uff09\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8eLLM\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u4f7fLLM\u7684AUC\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea68%\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6bd4DKT\u4f4e6%\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u65e9\u671f\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1bDKT\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u638c\u63e1\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u800cLLM\u53d8\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5f31\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u592a\u53ef\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u5df2\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u8f85\u5bfc\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728K-12\u6559\u80b2\u8fd9\u4e00\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

However, existing methods face challenges when dealing with large-scale sparse graphs and the need for a high degree of alignment between different datasets in transfer learning. Besides, although self-supervised methods have achieved remarkable success in many graph tasks, prior research has overlooked the potential of transfer learning to generalize across different graph datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Graph Attention Adaptive Transfer Network (GAATNet). It combines the advantages of pre-training and fine-tuning to capture global node embedding information across datasets of different scales, ensuring efficient knowledge transfer and improved LP performance. To enhance the model's generalization ability and accelerate training, we design two key strategies: 1) Incorporate distant neighbor embeddings as biases in the self-attention module to capture global features. 2) Introduce a lightweight self-adapter module during fine-tuning to improve training efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that GAATNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in LP tasks.

However, in deployment, computational constraints necessitate inference-time adaptation via reward-guided decoding (RGD) rather than per-user policy fine-tuning. This creates a critical but overlooked requirement: reward models must not only rank preferences accurately but also effectively guide token-level generation decisions. We demonstrate that standard RM accuracy fails catastrophically as a selection criterion for deployment-ready personalized alignment. Through systematic evaluation across three datasets, we introduce policy accuracy, a metric quantifying whether RGD scoring functions correctly discriminate between preferred and dispreferred responses. We show that RM accuracy correlates only weakly with this policy-level discrimination ability (Kendall's tau = 0.08--0.31). More critically, we introduce Pref-LaMP, the first personalized alignment benchmark with ground-truth user completions, enabling direct behavioral evaluation without circular reward-based metrics. On Pref-LaMP, we expose a complete decoupling between discrimination and generation: methods with 20-point RM accuracy differences produce almost identical output quality, and even methods achieving high discrimination fail to generate behaviorally aligned responses. Finally, simple in-context learning (ICL) dominates all reward-guided methods for models > 3B parameters, achieving 3-5 point ROUGE-1 gains over the best reward method at 7B scale. These findings show that the field optimizes proxy metrics that fail to predict deployment performance and do not translate preferences into real behavioral adaptation under deployment constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u65e0\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u9886\u57df\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u884c\u4e3a\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u8131\u8282\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u7814\u7a76\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u89e3\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u6392\u540d\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfctoken\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u7b56\u7565\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u91cf\u5316RGD\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u80fd\u5426\u6b63\u786e\u533a\u5206\u504f\u597d\u548c\u975e\u504f\u597d\u54cd\u5e94\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b3\uff09\u521b\u5efaPref-LaMP\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u5b8c\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u76f4\u63a5\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b4\uff09\u6bd4\u8f83\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "1\uff09RM\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u7ea7\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f88\u5f31\uff08Kendall's tau = 0.08-0.31\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u5728Pref-LaMP\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5373\u4f7fRM\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u76f8\u5dee20\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\uff1b3\uff09\u9ad8\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u672a\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff1b4\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8e>3B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57287B\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u5956\u52b1\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f973-5\u70b9ROUGE-1\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u9886\u57df\u5f53\u524d\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5c06\u504f\u597d\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u5b9e\u9645\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002"}}

The aim of the study was to develop a predictive model for assessing the risk of cardiac death based on the real and synthetic data of patients undergoing PCI and to identify the factors that have the greatest impact on mortality. We analyzed 2,044 patients, who underwent a PCI for bifurcation lesions. The primary outcome was cardiac death at 3-year follow-up. Several machine learning models were applied to predict three-year mortality after PCI. To address class imbalance and improve the representation of the minority class, an additional 500 synthetic samples were generated and added to the training set. To evaluate the contribution of individual features to model performance, we applied permutation feature importance. An additional experiment was conducted to evaluate how the model's predictions would change after removing non-informative features from the training and test datasets. Without oversampling, all models achieve high overall accuracy (0.92-0.93), yet they almost completely ignore the minority class. Across models, augmentation consistently increases minority-class recall with minimal loss of AUROC, improves probability quality, and yields more clinically reasonable risk estimates on the constructed severe profiles. According to feature importance analysis, four features emerged as the most influential: Age, Ejection Fraction, Peripheral Artery Disease, and Cerebrovascular Disease.

We introduce ChexReason, a vision-language model trained via R1-style methodology (SFT followed by GRPO) using only 2,000 SFT samples, 1,000 RL samples, and a single A100 GPU. Evaluations on CheXpert and NIH benchmarks reveal a fundamental tension: GRPO recovers in-distribution performance (23% improvement on CheXpert, macro-F1 = 0.346) but degrades cross-dataset transferability (19% drop on NIH). This mirrors high-resource models like NV-Reason-CXR-3B, suggesting the issue stems from the RL paradigm rather than scale. We identify a generalization paradox where the SFT checkpoint uniquely improves on NIH before optimization, indicating teacher-guided reasoning captures more institution-agnostic features. Furthermore, cross-model comparisons show structured reasoning scaffolds benefit general-purpose VLMs but offer minimal gain for medically pre-trained models.

Includes systematic physics ablation study, theoretical analysis, and downstream machine learning evaluation. Source code available at: https://github.com/Reckonchamp12/physics-constraint-paradox", "summary": "Physics-constrained data generation is essential for machine learning in scientific domains where real data are scarce; however, existing approaches often over-constrain models without identifying which physical components are necessary. We present a systematic ablation study of a physics-informed grating coupler spectrum generator that maps five geometric parameters to 100-point spectral responses. By selectively removing explicit energy conservation enforcement, Fabry-Perot oscillations, bandwidth variation, and noise, we uncover a physics constraint paradox: explicit energy conservation enforcement is mathematically redundant when the underlying equations are physically consistent, with constrained and unconstrained variants achieving identical conservation accuracy (mean error approximately 7 x 10^-9). In contrast, Fabry-Perot oscillations dominate threshold-based bandwidth variability, accounting for a 72 percent reduction in half-maximum bandwidth spread when removed (with bandwidth spread reduced from 132.3 nm to 37.4 nm). We further identify a subtle pitfall: standard noise-addition-plus-renormalization pipelines introduce 0.5 percent unphysical negative absorption values. The generator operates at 200 samples per second, enabling high-throughput data generation and remaining orders of magnitude faster than typical full-wave solvers reported in the literature. Finally, downstream machine learning evaluation reveals a clear physics-learnability trade-off: while central wavelength prediction remains unaffected, removing Fabry-Perot oscillations improves bandwidth prediction accuracy by 31.3 percent in R-squared and reduces RMSE by 73.8 percent.

However, we identify two fundamental limitations. First, the optimal policy depends on arbitrary modeling choices (scalarization function, reference policy), yielding behavior reflecting parameterization artifacts rather than true preferences. Second, treating response generation in isolation fails to leverage comparative information in pairwise data, leaving the model's capacity for intrinsic self-reflection untapped. To address it, we propose Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (\\q), deriving a globally optimal policy conditioning on both context and alternative responses. We prove this formulation superior to DPO/RLHF while guaranteeing invariance to scalarization and reference choices. \\q~serves as a plug-and-play enhancement without architectural changes or inference overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in win rates and length-controlled metrics, validating that unlocking self-reflection yields more robust, human-aligned LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faIntrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (q)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3DPO\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u610f\u5efa\u6a21\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b64\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u672a\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u6210\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "DPO\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff1a1) \u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u5efa\u6a21\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u884c\u4e3a\u53cd\u6620\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4f2a\u5f71\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u504f\u597d\uff1b2) \u5b64\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u672a\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u6210\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u672a\u5f00\u53d1\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIntrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (q)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u540c\u65f6\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u66ff\u4ee3\u54cd\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u67b6\u6784\u66f4\u6539\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u80dc\u7387\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5f00\u542f\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u80fd\u529b\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684LLMs\u3002", "conclusion": "q\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8eDPO/RLHF\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5bf9\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u9501\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

However, current state of the art PNN simulation tools face significant scalability challenges when training large-scale PNNs, due to the computational demands of transfer matrix calculations, resulting in high memory and time consumption. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Slicing method, an efficient transfer matrix computation approach compatible with back-propagation. We integrate this method into LuxIA, a unified simulation and training framework. The Slicing method substantially reduces memory usage and execution time, enabling scalable simulation and training of large PNNs. Experimental evaluations across various photonic architectures and standard datasets, including MNIST, Digits, and Olivetti Faces, show that LuxIA consistently surpasses existing tools in speed and scalability. Our results advance the state of the art in PNN simulation, making it feasible to explore and optimize larger, more complex architectures.

Human EI often involves a phenomenological component and a sense of understanding that artificially intelligent systems lack; therefore, some aspects of EI are irrelevant in evaluating AI systems. However, EI also includes an ability to sense an emotional state, explain it, respond appropriately, and adapt to new contexts (e.g., multicultural), and artificially intelligent systems can do such things to greater or lesser degrees. Several benchmark frameworks specialize in evaluating the capacity of different AI models to perform some tasks related to EI, but these often lack a solid foundation regarding the nature of emotion and what it is to be emotionally intelligent. In this project, we begin by reviewing different theories about emotion and general EI, evaluating the extent to which each is applicable to artificial systems. We then critically evaluate the available benchmark frameworks, identifying where each falls short in light of the account of EI developed in the first section. Lastly, we outline some options for improving evaluation strategies to avoid these shortcomings in EI evaluation in AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709AI\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u672a\u80fd\u5168\u9762\u8861\u91cfAI\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u5305\u542bAI\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u4f46AI\u4ecd\u80fd\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u60c5\u611f\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u54ea\u4e9b\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u4e0eAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u54ea\u4e9b\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd9\u662fAI\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7684\uff0c\u4f46AI\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u56de\u987e\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u611f\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u6279\u5224\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u672c\u8d28\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u4eba\u7c7b\u7279\u6709\u548cAI\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdbAI\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u533a\u5206\u4eba\u7c7b\u7279\u6709\u548cAI\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u907f\u514d\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002"}}

Temporal motifs, as an elementary unit and important local property of dynamic graphs which can directly reflect anomalies and unique phenomena, are essential for understanding their evolutionary dynamics and structural features. However, leveraging LLMs for temporal motif analysis on dynamic graphs remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we systematically study LLM performance on temporal motif-related tasks. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive benchmark, LLMTM (Large Language Models in Temporal Motifs), which includes six tailored tasks across nine temporal motif types. We then conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impacts of different prompting techniques and LLMs (including nine models: openPangu-7B, the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and o3) on model performance. Informed by our benchmark findings, we develop a tool-augmented LLM agent that leverages precisely engineered prompts to solve these tasks with high accuracy. Nevertheless, the high accuracy of the agent incurs a substantial cost. To address this trade-off, we propose a simple yet effective structure-aware dispatcher that considers both the dynamic graph's structural properties and the LLM's cognitive load to intelligently dispatch queries between the standard LLM prompting and the more powerful agent. Our experiments demonstrate that the structure-aware dispatcher effectively maintains high accuracy while reducing cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLM\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u4f53\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LLMTM\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u4f53\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5355\u5143\u548c\u91cd\u8981\u5c40\u90e8\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u53cd\u6620\u5f02\u5e38\u548c\u72ec\u7279\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51faLLMTM\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b6\u4e2a\u5b9a\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u548c9\u79cd\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u4f53\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b2. \u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u548cLLM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b3. \u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u786e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b4. \u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u548cLLM\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u8c03\u5ea6\u6807\u51c6LLM\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u4f53\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86LLM\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u4f53\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684LLMTM\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

While search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can explore alternatives, they are often ineffective when guided by sparse rewards and fail to leverage the rich semantic capabilities of LLMs. We introduce SPIRAL (Symbolic LLM Planning via Grounded and Reflective Search), a novel framework that embeds a cognitive architecture of three specialized LLM agents into an MCTS loop. SPIRAL's key contribution is its integrated planning pipeline where a Planner proposes creative next steps, a Simulator grounds the search by predicting realistic outcomes, and a Critic provides dense reward signals through reflection. This synergy transforms MCTS from a brute-force search into a guided, self-correcting reasoning process. On the DailyLifeAPIs and HuggingFace datasets, SPIRAL consistently outperforms the default Chain-of-Thought planning method and other state-of-the-art agents.

We present a hierarchical stacking optimization framework with a Dirichlet's Process (SoDip), a hierarchical data-driven framework integrating: (1) a decoder-only Transformer (DeepSeek-R1) to encode textual process descriptors (irradiation source, grafting type, substrate manufacturer); (2) TabNet and XGBoost for modelling multimodal feature interactions; (3) Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMM) for uncertainty quantification and heteroscedasticity; and (4) Bayesian Optimization for efficient exploration of high-dimensional synthesis space. A diverse dataset was curated using ChemDataExtractor 2.0 and WebPlotDigitizer, incorporating numerical and textual variables across hundreds of RIG studies.

Treating an LLM's output (\"model choice\") as a single data point underutilizes the information inherent to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. This paper introduces and formalizes \"model belief,\" a measure derived from an LLM's token-level probabilities that captures the model's belief distribution over choice alternatives in a single generation run. The authors prove that model belief is asymptotically equivalent to the mean of model choices (a non-trivial property) but forms a more statistically efficient estimator, with lower variance and a faster convergence rate. Analogous properties are shown to hold for smooth functions of model belief and model choice often used in downstream applications. The authors demonstrate the performance of model belief through a demand estimation study, where an LLM simulates consumer responses to different prices. In practical settings with limited numbers of runs, model belief explains and predicts ground-truth model choice better than model choice itself, and reduces the computation needed to reach sufficiently accurate estimates by roughly a factor of 20.

Code available at https://github.com/varshith-Git/Valori-Kernel", "summary": "Modern AI systems rely on vector embeddings stored and searched using floating-point arithmetic. While effective for approximate similarity search, this design introduces fundamental non-determinism: identical models, inputs, and code can produce different memory states and retrieval results across hardware architectures (e.g., x86 vs. ARM). This prevents replayability and safe deployment, leading to silent data divergence that prevents post-hoc verification and compromises audit trails in regulated sectors. We present Valori, a deterministic AI memory substrate that replaces floating-point memory operations with fixed-point arithmetic (Q16.16) and models memory as a replayable state machine. Valori guarantees bit-identical memory states, snapshots, and search results across platforms.

Thermal comfort, a sophisticated interplay of environmental factors and personal perceptions involving sensory integration and adaptive decision-making, serves as an ideal paradigm for evaluating real-world cognitive capabilities of AI systems. To address this, we propose TCEval, the first evaluation framework that assesses three core cognitive capacities of AI, cross-modal reasoning, causal association, and adaptive decision-making, by leveraging thermal comfort scenarios and large language model (LLM) agents. The methodology involves initializing LLM agents with virtual personality attributes, guiding them to generate clothing insulation selections and thermal comfort feedback, and validating outputs against the ASHRAE Global Database and Chinese Thermal Comfort Database. Experiments on four LLMs show that while agent feedback has limited exact alignment with humans, directional consistency improves significantly with a 1 PMV tolerance. Statistical tests reveal that LLM-generated PMV distributions diverge markedly from human data, and agents perform near-randomly in discrete thermal comfort classification. These results confirm the feasibility of TCEval as an ecologically valid Cognitive Turing Test for AI, demonstrating that current LLMs possess foundational cross-modal reasoning ability but lack precise causal understanding of the nonlinear relationships between variables in thermal comfort. TCEval complements traditional benchmarks, shifting AI evaluation focus from abstract task proficiency to embodied, context-aware perception and decision-making, offering valuable insights for advancing AI in human-centric applications like smart buildings.", "AI": {"tldr": "TCEval\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u70ed\u8212\u9002\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u6838\u5fc3\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u8054\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51b3\u7b56\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u70ed\u8212\u9002\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5177\u5907\u57fa\u7840\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u56e0\u679c\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7a7a\u767d\u3002\u70ed\u8212\u9002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d89\u53ca\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4eba\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u611f\u5b98\u6574\u5408\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTCEval\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5177\u6709\u865a\u62df\u4eba\u683c\u5c5e\u6027\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5176\u751f\u6210\u670d\u88c5\u9694\u70ed\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u70ed\u8212\u9002\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0eASHRAE\u5168\u7403\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u4e2d\u56fd\u70ed\u8212\u9002\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u56db\u4e2aLLM\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u4ee3\u7406\u53cd\u9988\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u9f50\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u57281 PMV\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u4e0b\u65b9\u5411\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\uff1b\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660eLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684PMV\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u70ed\u8212\u9002\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u3002", "conclusion": "TCEval\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u6001\u6709\u6548\u7684AI\u8ba4\u77e5\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5177\u5907\u57fa\u7840\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u70ed\u8212\u9002\u4e2d\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u56e0\u679c\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06AI\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cd\u70b9\u4ece\u62bd\u8c61\u4efb\u52a1\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u8f6c\u5411\u5177\u8eab\u3001\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

Compared to baseline models, the proposed method accelerates the convergence process and improves solution accuracy by at least an order of magnitude without introducing additional computational complexity.

Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural limitation. Perception-centric architectures optimize parameter-space imitation, whereas safety-critical control demands outcome-space guarantees over executed actions. Here, we present a fundamentally different pathway toward domain-specific foundation models by introducing compact language models operating as Agentic Physical AI, in which policy optimization is driven by physics-based validation rather than perceptual inference. We train a 360-million-parameter model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling the dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples. This induces a sharp phase transition absent in general-purpose models. Small-scale systems exhibit high-variance imitation with catastrophic tail risk, while large-scale models undergo variance collapse exceeding 500x reduction, stabilizing execution-level behavior. Despite balanced exposure to four actuation families, the model autonomously rejects approximately 70% of the training distribution and concentrates 95% of runtime execution on a single-bank strategy. Learned representations transfer across distinct physics and continuous input modalities without architectural modification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u7406AI\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u7d27\u51d1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u53cd\u5e94\u5806\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u6a21\u4eff\u5230\u7a33\u5b9a\u6267\u884c\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8fdc\u8d85\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u524d\u6cbf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e5f\u53ea\u670950-53%\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u66f4\u50cf\u662f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u731c\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4f46\u8fdd\u53cd\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0d\u662f\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u5fc3\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u63a7\u5236\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u7269\u7406AI\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7531\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9a71\u52a8\u800c\u975e\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u5728\u5408\u6210\u53cd\u5e94\u5806\u63a7\u5236\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a3.6\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ece10^3\u6269\u5c55\u523010^5\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6025\u5267\u76f8\u53d8\uff1a\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u6a21\u4eff\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5386\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7500\u500d\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u7ea7\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5e73\u8861\u66b4\u9732\u4e8e\u56db\u79cd\u9a71\u52a8\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u4e3b\u62d2\u7edd\u4e86\u7ea670%\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5c0695%\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u6267\u884c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\u3002\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u65e0\u9700\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u5373\u53ef\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u7406AI\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u6a21\u4eff\u5230\u7a33\u5b9a\u6267\u884c\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u5728\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u63a7\u5236\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent GAN-based methods have demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing load patterns, but most existing approaches treat all devices uniformly within a single model, neglecting the behavioral differences between intermittent and continuous appliances and resulting in unstable training and limited output fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose the Cluster Aggregated GAN framework, a hybrid generative approach that routes each appliance to a specialized branch based on its behavioral characteristics. For intermittent appliances, a clustering module groups similar activation patterns and allocates dedicated generators for each cluster, ensuring that both common and rare operational modes receive adequate modeling capacity. Continuous appliances follow a separate branch that employs an LSTM-based generator to capture gradual temporal evolution while maintaining training stability through sequence compression. Extensive experiments on the UVIC smart plug dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline methods across metrics measuring realism, diversity, and training stability, and that integrating clustering as an active generative component substantially improves both interpretability and scalability. These findings establish the proposed framework as an effective approach for synthetic load generation in non-intrusive load monitoring research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCluster Aggregated GAN\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u7535\u5668\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6839\u636e\u7535\u5668\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff09\u5c06\u8bbe\u5907\u8def\u7531\u5230\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5408\u6210\u7535\u5668\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u8d1f\u8f7d\u76d1\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u7814\u7a76\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u969c\u788d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eGAN\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u8bbe\u5907\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7535\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Cluster Aggregated GAN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6839\u636e\u7535\u5668\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7535\u5668\u8def\u7531\u5230\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5206\u652f\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u7535\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u805a\u7c7b\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u914d\u4e13\u7528\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5e38\u89c1\u548c\u7f55\u89c1\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u90fd\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7535\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLSTM\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6765\u6355\u6349\u6e10\u8fdb\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u538b\u7f29\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728UVIC\u667a\u80fd\u63d2\u5ea7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8861\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5c06\u805a\u7c7b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7ec4\u4ef6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Cluster Aggregated GAN\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u8d1f\u8f7d\u76d1\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8d1f\u8f7d\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7535\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Conformant planning is the task of finding a sequential plan that achieves a given objective independent of non-deterministic action effects during the plan's execution. Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces of a system and, e.g., capture information-flow and fairness policies. In this paper, we show that model-checking of $\\exists^*\\forall^*$ hyperproperties is closely related to the problem of computing a conformant plan. Firstly, we show that we can efficiently reduce a hyperproperty model-checking instance to a conformant planning instance, and prove that our encoding is sound and complete. Secondly, we establish the converse direction: Every conformant planning problem is, itself, a hyperproperty model-checking task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff1a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u8d85\u5c5e\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u65e8\u5728\u627e\u5230\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u4f5c\u6548\u679c\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u800c\u8d85\u5c5e\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u9a8c\u5219\u6d89\u53ca\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u4e2a\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f8\u4e92\u9ad8\u6548\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u793e\u533a\u4e2d\u4e24\u4e2a\u770b\u4f3c\u4e0d\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u5173\u6ce8\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u4f5c\u6548\u679c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u627e\u5230\u4fdd\u8bc1\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u800c\u8d85\u5c5e\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u9a8c\u5219\u7528\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7b49\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u4e2a\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\uff1a\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u8d85\u5c5e\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u9a8c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u7ea6\u7b80\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u76f8\u53cd\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u672c\u8eab\u5c31\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d85\u5c5e\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u9a8c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u2203*\u2200*\u8d85\u5c5e\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u9a8c\u95ee\u9898\u9ad8\u6548\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff1b2\uff09\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d85\u5c5e\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u9a8c\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b3\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7d27\u5bc6\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u5171\u4eab\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u8d85\u5c5e\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u9a8c\u95ee\u9898\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f8\u4e92\u8f6c\u6362\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u793e\u533a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u9a8c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53cd\u4e4b\u4ea6\u7136\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e24\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u534f\u540c\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, a notable discrepancy exists between their training and inference procedures. In particular, MDM inference is a multi-step, iterative process governed not only by the model itself but also by various schedules that dictate the token-decoding trajectory (e.g., how many tokens to decode at each step). In contrast, MDMs are typically trained using a simplified, single-step BERT-style objective that masks a subset of tokens and predicts all of them simultaneously. This step-level simplification fundamentally disconnects the training paradigm from the trajectory-level nature of inference, leaving the inference schedules never optimized during training. In this paper, we introduce Co-GRPO, which reformulates MDM generation as a unified Markov Decision Process (MDP) that jointly incorporates both the model and the inference schedule. By applying Group Relative Policy Optimization at the trajectory level, Co-GRPO cooperatively optimizes model parameters and schedule parameters under a shared reward, without requiring costly backpropagation through the multi-step generation process. This holistic optimization aligns training with inference more thoroughly and substantially improves generation quality. Empirical results across four benchmarks-ImageReward, HPS, GenEval, and DPG-Bench-demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

We identify three core cognitive challenges hindering this transition: spatial reasoning, long-horizon state tracking via mental simulation, and active exploration under partial observation. To isolate and evaluate these faculties, we introduce CubeBench, a novel generative benchmark centered on the Rubik's Cube. CubeBench uses a three-tiered diagnostic framework that progressively assesses agent capabilities, from foundational state tracking with full symbolic information to active exploration with only partial visual data. Our experiments on leading LLMs reveal critical limitations, including a uniform 0.00% pass rate on all long-horizon tasks, exposing a fundamental failure in long-term planning.

Standard tools often miss what is happening because worker responses to algorithmic systems are rarely linear. We use a Double Machine Learning framework to estimate a moderated mediation model without imposing restrictive functional forms. Using survey data from 464 gig workers, we find a clear nonmonotonic pattern. Supportive HR practices improve worker wellbeing, but their link to performance weakens in a murky middle where algorithmic oversight is present yet hard to interpret. The relationship strengthens again when oversight is transparent and explainable. These results show why simple linear specifications can miss the pattern and sometimes suggest the opposite conclusion. For platform design, the message is practical: control that is only partly defined creates confusion, but clear rules and credible recourse can make strong oversight workable. Methodologically, the paper shows how Double Machine Learning can be used to estimate conditional indirect effects in organizational research without forcing the data into a linear shape.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7814\u7a76\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0b\u7684\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u5b9e\u8df5\u5bf9\u96f6\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff1a\u652f\u6301\u6027HR\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u5347\u5e78\u798f\u611f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u7cca\u4e0d\u6e05\u65f6\u4e0e\u7ee9\u6548\u7684\u5173\u8054\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u5f53\u76d1\u7763\u900f\u660e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65f6\u5173\u8054\u518d\u6b21\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ba1\u7406\u65f6\u4ee3\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u662f\u5426\u8fd8\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u5e38\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5230\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\u76d1\u7763\u5982\u4f55\u8c03\u8282HR\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0e\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4f30\u8ba1\u8c03\u8282\u4e2d\u4ecb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0d\u65bd\u52a0\u9650\u5236\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u4f7f\u7528464\u540d\u96f6\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u652f\u6301\u6027HR\u5b9e\u8df5\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u76d1\u7763\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u5e78\u798f\u611f\u548c\u7ee9\u6548\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u652f\u6301\u6027HR\u5b9e\u8df5\u6539\u5584\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u5e78\u798f\u611f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e0e\u7ee9\u6548\u7684\u5173\u8054\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u7cca\u4e0d\u6e05\u7684\"\u7070\u8272\u4e2d\u95f4\u5730\u5e26\"\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u5f53\u76d1\u7763\u53d8\u5f97\u900f\u660e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5173\u8054\u518d\u6b21\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u7b80\u5355\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u9519\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u751a\u81f3\u5f97\u51fa\u76f8\u53cd\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e73\u53f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e94\u907f\u514d\u90e8\u5206\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u7533\u8bc9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f3a\u76d1\u7763\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e0a\uff0c\u53cc\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u6761\u4ef6\u95f4\u63a5\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u5f3a\u884c\u62df\u5408\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u5f62\u72b6\u3002"}}

Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) agents capable of autonomous reasoning and tool invocation are rapidly emerging as a powerful approach for complex decision-making tasks involving multi-step interactions with external environments. In this work, we introduce MindWatcher, a TIR agent integrating interleaved thinking and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. MindWatcher can autonomously decide whether and how to invoke diverse tools and coordinate their use, without relying on human prompts or workflows. The interleaved thinking paradigm enables the model to switch between thinking and tool calling at any intermediate stage, while its multimodal CoT capability allows manipulation of images during reasoning to yield more precise search results. We implement automated data auditing and evaluation pipelines, complemented by manually curated high-quality datasets for training, and we construct a benchmark, called MindWatcher-Evaluate Bench (MWE-Bench), to evaluate its performance. MindWatcher is equipped with a comprehensive suite of auxiliary reasoning tools, enabling it to address broad-domain multimodal problems.

However, existing graph anomaly detection methods often face significant challenges when dealing with complex and variable abnormal patterns, as anomalous nodes are often disguised and mixed with normal nodes, leading to the coexistence of homophily and heterophily in the graph domain. Recent spectral graph neural networks have made notable progress in addressing this issue; however, current techniques typically employ fixed, globally shared filters. This 'one-size-fits-all' approach can easily cause over-smoothing, erasing critical high-frequency signals needed for fraud detection, and lacks adaptive capabilities for different graph instances. To solve this problem, we propose a Multi-Head Spectral-Adaptive Graph Neural Network (MHSA-GNN). The core innovation is the design of a lightweight hypernetwork that, conditioned on a 'spectral fingerprint' containing structural statistics and Rayleigh quotient features, dynamically generates Chebyshev filter parameters tailored to each instance. This enables a customized filtering strategy for each node and its local subgraph. Additionally, to prevent mode collapse in the multi-head mechanism, we introduce a novel dual regularization strategy that combines teacher-student contrastive learning (TSC) to ensure representation accuracy and Barlow Twins diversity loss (BTD) to enforce orthogonality among heads.

A Computationally-Embedded Perspective on the Big World Hypothesis", "comment": "NeurIPS 2025 (spotlight)", "summary": "Continual learning is often motivated by the idea, known as the big world hypothesis, that \"the world is bigger\" than the agent. Recent problem formulations capture this idea by explicitly constraining an agent relative to the environment. These constraints lead to solutions in which the agent continually adapts to best use its limited capacity, rather than converging to a fixed solution. However, explicit constraints can be ad hoc, difficult to incorporate, and may limit the effectiveness of scaling up the agent's capacity. In this paper, we characterize a problem setting in which an agent, regardless of its capacity, is constrained by being embedded in the environment. In particular, we introduce a computationally-embedded perspective that represents an embedded agent as an automaton simulated within a universal (formal) computer. Such an automaton is always constrained; we prove that it is equivalent to an agent that interacts with a partially observable Markov decision process over a countably infinite state-space. We propose an objective for this setting, which we call interactivity, that measures an agent's ability to continually adapt its behaviour by learning new predictions. We then develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for interactivity-seeking, and use it to construct a synthetic problem to evaluate continual learning capability. Our results show that deep nonlinear networks struggle to sustain interactivity, whereas deep linear networks sustain higher interactivity as capacity increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89c6\u4e3a\u5728\u901a\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u4e0e\u65e0\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8861\u91cf\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u8bbe\u5b9a\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6765\u4f53\u73b0\"\u4e16\u754c\u5927\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\"\u7684\u5927\u4e16\u754c\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u968f\u610f\u6027\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bb9\u91cf\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u89d2\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u751f\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8ba1\u7b97\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5728\u901a\u7528\uff08\u5f62\u5f0f\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u4e0e\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6570\u65e0\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684POMDP\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u9884\u6d4b\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u5bfb\u6c42\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u8bc4\u4f30\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u96be\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u968f\u7740\u5bb9\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u80fd\u591f\u7ef4\u6301\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u89d2\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u7ea6\u675f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1b\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8861\u91cf\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u7ef4\u6301\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5bb9\u91cf\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002"}}

In experiments reported here, models exposed to such warnings reproduced the flagged content at rates statistically indistinguishable from models given the content directly (76.7% vs. 83.3%). Why? Sparse autoencoder analysis points to a failure of orthogonalization: \"describing X\" and \"performing X\" activate overlapping latent features. Feature #8684, which tracks code execution patterns, fires at comparable magnitude in both warning and exploitation contexts. A related phenomenon, what I call \"stealth slip\", allows conversational preambles to rotate activations into subspaces that linear probes miss entirely. Prompting and inference-time steering do not fix this; training-time feature ablation does. The upshot is that statistical co-occurrence dominates over pragmatic interpretation in current architectures.

However, manual optimization cannot keep pace with these demands, creating a critical bottleneck in AI system development. Recent advances in LLM code generation capabilities have opened new possibilities for automating kernel development.

The system's modular design allows rapid integration of new DSLs and hardware targets.

Our central finding validates the Interference Hypothesis: by leveraging quantum feature maps (Angle Embedding) and wave interference, the Quantum Router acts as a high-dimensional kernel method, enabling the modeling of complex, non-linear decision boundaries with superior parameter efficiency compared to its classical counterparts. Experimental results on non-linearly separable data, such as the Two Moons dataset, demonstrate that the Quantum Router achieves a significant topological advantage, effectively \"untangling\" data distributions that linear classical routers fail to separate efficiently. Furthermore, we analyze the architecture's robustness against simulated quantum noise, confirming its feasibility for near-term intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. We discuss practical applications in federated learning, privacy-preserving machine learning, and adaptive systems that could benefit from this quantum-enhanced routing paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u6548\u5e94\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5177\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u6765\u6e90\u3002\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u6ce2\u5e72\u6d89\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\"\u89e3\u5f00\"\u7ebf\u6027\u7ecf\u5178\u8def\u7531\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u566a\u58f0\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8fd1\u671f\u4e2d\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8def\u7531\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u6548\u5e94\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Despite the encouraging results, RL improvement inevitably relies on sampling successful, high-quality responses; however, the initial model often struggles to generate responses that satisfy all constraints due to its limited capabilities, yielding sparse or indistinguishable rewards that impede learning. In this work, we propose Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR), a novel sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following tasks, which employs a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on the constraints that have been satisfied in hindsight. We perform RL on these replayed samples as well as the original ones, theoretically framing the objective as dual-preference learning at both the instruction- and response-level to enable efficient optimization using only a binary reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HiR yields promising results across different instruction following tasks, while requiring less computational budget.

Accurately predicting startup success requires synthesizing complex relational evidence, including company disclosures, investor track records, and investment network structures, through explicit reasoning to form coherent, interpretable investment theses. Traditional machine learning and graph neural networks both lack this reasoning capability. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning but face a modality mismatch with graphs. Recent graph-LLM methods target in-graph tasks where answers lie within the graph, whereas VC prediction is off-graph: the target exists outside the network. The core challenge is selecting graph paths that maximize predictor performance on an external objective while enabling step-by-step reasoning. We present MIRAGE-VC, a multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation framework that addresses two obstacles: path explosion (thousands of candidate paths overwhelm LLM context) and heterogeneous evidence fusion (different startups need different analytical emphasis). Our information-gain-driven path retriever iteratively selects high-value neighbors, distilling investment networks into compact chains for explicit reasoning. A multi-agent architecture integrates three evidence streams via a learnable gating mechanism based on company attributes. Under strict anti-leakage controls, MIRAGE-VC achieves +5.0% F1 and +16.6% PrecisionAt5, and sheds light on other off-graph prediction tasks such as recommendation and risk assessment.

While conventional PD models prioritize predictive accuracy during model development with complex machine learning algorithms, they often overlook continuous adaptation to changing borrower behaviour, resulting in static models that degrade over time in production and generate inaccurate default predictions. Many financial institutes also find it difficult transitioning ML models from development environment to production and maintaining their health. With PDx we aimed to addresses these limitations using a dynamic, end-to-end model lifecycle management approach that integrates continuous model monitoring, retraining, and validation through a robust MLOps pipeline. We introduced a dynamic champion-challenger framework for PDx to regularly update baseline models to recalibrate independent parameters with the latest data and select the best-performing model through out-of-time validation, ensuring resilience against data drift and changing credit risk patterns. Our empirical analysis shows that decision tree-based ensemble models consistently outperform others in classifying defaulters but require frequent updates to sustain performance. Linear models (e.g., logistic regression) and neural networks exhibit greater performance degradation. The study demonstrate with PDx we can mitigates value erosion for digital lenders, particularly in short-term, small-ticket loans, where borrower behavior shifts rapidly. We have validated the effectiveness of PDx using datasets from peer-to-peer lending, business loans, and auto loans, demonstrating its scalability and adaptability for modern credit risk forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "PDx\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eMLOps\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u501f\u8d37\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u51a0\u519b-\u6311\u6218\u8005\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\u76d1\u63a7\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfPD\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPD\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u9636\u6bb5\u6ce8\u91cd\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u501f\u6b3e\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u5728\u5c06ML\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u5f00\u53d1\u73af\u5883\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u5e76\u7ef4\u62a4\u5176\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u5065\u7684MLOps\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u96c6\u6210\u6301\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u51a0\u519b-\u6311\u6218\u8005\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9a\u671f\u66f4\u65b0\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u6700\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\u72ec\u7acb\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5916\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u8fdd\u7ea6\u8005\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9891\u7e41\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\uff09\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002PDx\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u8f7b\u6570\u5b57\u8d37\u6b3e\u673a\u6784\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u4fb5\u8680\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u3001\u5c0f\u989d\u8d37\u6b3e\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u501f\u6b3e\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u8fc5\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "PDx\u901a\u8fc7MLOps\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfPD\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u501f\u8d37\u3001\u5546\u4e1a\u8d37\u6b3e\u548c\u6c7d\u8f66\u8d37\u6b3e\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u4fe1\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we show that addressing these challenges requires AI agents that can reason under uncertainty and handle both incomplete and non-Archimedean preferences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u786e\u4fddAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7AI\u8f85\u52a9\u548cAI\u5173\u673a\u6e38\u620f\u6846\u67b6\u7814\u7a76\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5177\u5907\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5904\u7406\u975e\u963f\u57fa\u7c73\u5fb7\u504f\u597d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u786e\u4fddAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002AI\u8f85\u52a9\u95ee\u9898\u6d89\u53ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u4eba\u7c7b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5176\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u7684AI\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u53ea\u6709\u4eba\u7c7b\u77e5\u9053\u8fd9\u4e9b\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u5173\u673a\u95ee\u9898\u6d89\u53ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u5728\u6309\u4e0b\u5173\u673a\u6309\u94ae\u65f6\u5173\u95ed\u3001\u4e0d\u963b\u6b62\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5bfc\u81f4\u6309\u94ae\u88ab\u6309\u4e0b\u3001\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u80dc\u4efb\u4efb\u52a1\u7684AI\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7AI\u8f85\u52a9\u6e38\u620f\u548cAI\u5173\u673a\u6e38\u620f\u4e24\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7814\u7a76AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002AI\u8f85\u52a9\u6e38\u620f\u5173\u6ce8AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5b66\u4e60\u4eba\u7c7b\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\uff1bAI\u5173\u673a\u6e38\u620f\u5173\u6ce8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6b63\u786e\u5173\u673a\u7684AI\u4ee3\u7406\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u9700\u8981AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5177\u5907\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5904\u7406\u975e\u963f\u57fa\u7c73\u5fb7\u504f\u597d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\u9700\u8981AI\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u591f\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff1b2\uff09\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b3\uff09\u5904\u7406\u975e\u963f\u57fa\u7c73\u5fb7\u504f\u597d\uff08\u5373\u4e0d\u540c\u4ef7\u503c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65e0\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u6bd4\u8f83\u6216\u6743\u8861\u7684\u504f\u597d\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u786e\u4fddAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u504f\u597d\u7684AI\u4ee3\u7406\u3002AI\u8f85\u52a9\u548cAI\u5173\u673a\u6e38\u620f\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u7528\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u9700\u8981AI\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u548c\u975e\u963f\u57fa\u7c73\u5fb7\u504f\u597d\u3002"}}

First, a cross-model attention mechanism enables successor models to access and fuse hidden states from predecessors, facilitating hierarchical error correction and knowledge transfer. Second, a chain training paradigm progressively fine-tunes connected models with an error-suppression objective, ensuring that each model rectifies the mispredictions of its predecessor with minimal additional computation. Third, a near-parallel inference paradigm design pipelines hidden states across models layer by layer, achieving inference efficiency approaching single-model decoding. We further establish the theoretical foundations of LLMBoost, proving that sequential integration guarantees monotonic improvements under bounded correction assumptions.

However, LLMs are fundamentally limited by the ``Artificial Hivemind'' effect, where they generate similar responses within the same model and produce homogeneous outputs across different models. As a consequence, students may be exposed to overly similar and repetitive LLM-generated problems, which harms diversity of thought. Drawing inspiration from Wallas's theory of creativity and Guilford's framework of divergent-convergent thinking, we propose CreativeDC, a two-phase prompting method that explicitly scaffolds the LLM's reasoning into distinct phases. By decoupling creative exploration from constraint satisfaction, our method enables LLMs to explore a broader space of ideas before committing to a final problem. We evaluate CreativeDC for creative problem generation using a comprehensive set of metrics that capture diversity, novelty, and utility. The results show that CreativeDC achieves significantly higher diversity and novelty compared to baselines while maintaining high utility.

We study online learning of a one-dimensional threshold policy from bandit feedback under demographic parity (DP) and, optionally, service-rate constraints. The learner observes only a scalar score each round and selects a threshold; reward and constraint residuals are revealed only for the chosen threshold.\n  We propose Optimistic Feasible Search (OFS), a simple grid-based method that maintains confidence bounds for reward and constraint residuals for each candidate threshold. At each round, OFS selects a threshold that appears feasible under confidence bounds and, among those, maximizes optimistic reward; if no threshold appears feasible, OFS selects the threshold minimizing optimistic constraint violation. This design directly targets feasible high-utility thresholds and is particularly effective for low-dimensional, interpretable policy classes where discretization is natural.\n  We evaluate OFS on (i) a synthetic closed-loop benchmark with stable contraction dynamics and (ii) two semi-synthetic closed-loop benchmarks grounded in German Credit and COMPAS, constructed by training a score model and feeding group-dependent acceptance decisions back into population composition. Across all environments, OFS achieves higher reward with smaller cumulative constraint violation than unconstrained and primal-dual bandit baselines, and is near-oracle relative to the best feasible fixed threshold under the same sweep procedure.

Assaad"], "title": "Regret-Based Federated Causal Discovery with Unknown Interventions", "comment": null, "summary": "Most causal discovery methods recover a completed partially directed acyclic graph representing a Markov equivalence class from observational data. Recent work has extended these methods to federated settings to address data decentralization and privacy constraints, but often under idealized assumptions that all clients share the same causal model. Such assumptions are unrealistic in practice, as client-specific policies or protocols, for example, across hospitals, naturally induce heterogeneous and unknown interventions. In this work, we address federated causal discovery under unknown client-level interventions. We propose I-PERI, a novel federated algorithm that first recovers the CPDAG of the union of client graphs and then orients additional edges by exploiting structural differences induced by interventions across clients. This yields a tighter equivalence class, which we call the $\\mathbf\u03a6$-Markov Equivalence Class, represented by the $\\mathbf\u03a6$-CPDAG.

We identify a fundamental limitation: these variances are relation-agnostic, meaning an entity receives identical uncertainty regardless of relational context. This conflates two distinct out-of-distribution phenomena that behave oppositely: emerging entities (rare, poorly-learned) and novel relational contexts (familiar entities in unobserved relationships). We prove an impossibility result: any uncertainty estimator using only entity-level statistics independent of relation context achieves near-random OOD detection on novel contexts. We empirically validate this on three datasets, finding 100 percent of novel-context triples have frequency-matched in-distribution counterparts. This explains why existing probabilistic methods achieve 0.99 AUROC on random corruptions but only 0.52-0.64 on temporal distribution shift. We formalize uncertainty decomposition into complementary components: semantic uncertainty from entity embedding variance (detecting emerging entities) and structural uncertainty from entity-relation co-occurrence (detecting novel contexts). Our main theoretical result proves these signals are non-redundant, and that any convex combination strictly dominates either signal alone. Our method (CAGP) combines semantic and structural uncertainty via learned weights, achieving 0.94-0.99 AUROC on temporal OOD detection across multiple benchmarks, a 60-80 percent relative improvement over relation-agnostic baselines. Empirical validation confirms complete frequency overlap on three datasets (FB15k-237, WN18RR, YAGO3-10).

Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the expense of controllability and practical engineering. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and ``physics'' are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration.

This paper addresses a critical gap by integrating Global M2 Liquidity, aggregated from 18 major economies, as a leading exogenous variable with a 12-week lag structure. Using the TimeXer architecture, we compare a liquidity-conditioned forecasting model (TimeXer-Exog) against state-of-the-art benchmarks including LSTM, N-BEATS, PatchTST, and a standard univariate TimeXer. Experiments conducted on daily Bitcoin price data from January 2020 to August 2025 demonstrate that explicit macroeconomic conditioning significantly stabilizes long-horizon forecasts. At a 70-day forecast horizon, the proposed TimeXer-Exog model achieves a mean squared error (MSE) 1.08e8, outperforming the univariate TimeXer baseline by over 89 percent.

Our instruction-tuning experiments show that LoRA-based supervised fine-tuning can catastrophically degrade model capabilities, even when trained on very small datasets for relatively few steps. With that said, we demonstrate that while the most straightforward approach (that is likely the most used in practice) fails spectacularly, small tweaks to the training procedure with very little overhead can virtually eliminate the problem. Particularly, in this paper we consider a regularized approximate replay approach which penalizes KL divergence with respect to the initial model and interleaves in data for next token prediction from a different, yet similar, open access corpus to what was used in pre-training.

Recent works on neural network parameterisations, such as $\u03bc$P, have enabled transfer of optimal global hyperparameters across model sizes. These works propose an empirical practice of search for optimal global base hyperparameters at a small model size, and transfer to a large size. We extend these works in two key ways. To handle scaling along most important scaling axes, we propose the Complete$^{(d)}$ Parameterisation that unifies scaling in width and depth -- using an adaptation of CompleteP -- as well as in batch-size and training duration. Secondly, with our parameterisation, we investigate per-module hyperparameter optimisation and transfer. We characterise the empirical challenges of navigating the high-dimensional hyperparameter landscape, and propose practical guidelines for tackling this optimisation problem. We demonstrate that, with the right parameterisation, hyperparameter transfer holds even in the per-module hyperparameter regime. Our study covers an extensive range of optimisation hyperparameters of modern models: learning rates, AdamW parameters, weight decay, initialisation scales, and residual block multipliers.

However, its linear adaptation process limits its expressive power. This means there is a gap between the expressive power of linear training and non-linear training. To bridge this gap, we propose AFA-LoRA, a novel training strategy that brings non-linear expressivity to LoRA while maintaining its seamless mergeability. Our key innovation is an annealed activation function that transitions from a non-linear to a linear transformation during training, allowing the adapter to initially adopt stronger representational capabilities before converging to a mergeable linear form.

This paper develops AMBIT, a gray-box framework that augments physical mobility baselines with interpretable tree models. We begin with a comprehensive audit of classical spatial interaction models on a year-long, hourly NYC taxi OD dataset. The audit shows that most physical models are fragile at this temporal resolution; PPML gravity is the strongest physical baseline, while constrained variants improve when calibrated on full OD margins but remain notably weaker. We then build residual learners on top of physical baselines using gradient-boosted trees and SHAP analysis, demonstrating that (i) physics-grounded residuals approach the accuracy of a strong tree-based predictor while retaining interpretable structure, and (ii) POI-anchored residuals are consistently competitive and most robust under spatial generalization.

Yet, new target domains often require domain expansion: a generalized model that performs well beyond any single specialist's domain. Given such a new target domain, prior works seek a single strong initialization prior for the model parameters by first blending expert models to initialize a target model. However, heuristic blending -- using coefficients based on data size or proxy metrics -- often yields lower target-domain test accuracy, and learning the coefficients on the target loss typically requires computationally-expensive full backpropagation through the network. We propose GLUE, Gradient-free Learning To Unify Experts, which initializes the target model as a convex combination of fixed experts, learning the mixture coefficients of this combination via a gradient-free two-point (SPSA) update that requires only two forward passes per step. Across experiments on three datasets and three network architectures, GLUE produces a single prior that can be fine-tuned effectively to outperform baselines. GLUE improves test accuracy by up to 8.5% over data-size weighting and by up to 9.1% over proxy-metric selection.

We address this by constructing \\emph{Bayesian wind tunnels} -- controlled environments where the true posterior is known in closed form and memorization is provably impossible. In these settings, small transformers reproduce Bayesian posteriors with \\mbox{$10^{-3}$--$10^{-4}$} bit accuracy, while capacity-matched MLPs fail by orders of magnitude, establishing a clear architectural separation.\n  Across two tasks -- bijection elimination and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) state tracking -- we find that transformers implement Bayesian inference through a consistent geometric mechanism: residual streams serve as the belief substrate, feed-forward networks perform the posterior update, and attention provides content-addressable routing.

Existing solutions typically rely on periodic classifier retraining, resulting in high computational overhead and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a scalable framework for adaptive IoT threat detection that eliminates the need for continuous classifier retraining. The proposed approach trains a classifier once on latent-space representations of historical traffic, while an alignment model maps incoming traffic to the learned historical latent space prior to classification, thereby preserving knowledge of previously observed attacks. To capture inter-instance relationships among attack samples, the low-dimensional latent representations are further transformed into a graph-structured format and classified using a graph neural network. Experimental evaluations on real-world heterogeneous IoT traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains robust detection performance under concept drift.

With the growing reliance on fine-tuning large pretrained models, we investigate whether LTH extends to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), specifically focusing on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods. Our key finding is that LTH holds within LoRAs, revealing sparse subnetworks that can match the performance of dense adapters. In particular, we find that the effectiveness of sparse subnetworks depends more on how much sparsity is applied in each layer than on the exact weights included in the subnetwork. Building on this insight, we propose Partial-LoRA, a method that systematically identifies said subnetworks and trains sparse low-rank adapters aligned with task-relevant subspaces of the pre-trained model. Experiments across 8 vision and 12 language tasks in both single-task and multi-task settings show that Partial-LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters by up to 87\\%, while maintaining or improving accuracy. Our results not only deepen our theoretical understanding of transfer learning and the interplay between pretraining and fine-tuning but also open new avenues for developing more efficient adaptation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f69\u7968\u5047\u8bbe\u5728LoRA\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faPartial-LoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u51cf\u5c1187%\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63a2\u7d22\u5f69\u7968\u5047\u8bbe\u662f\u5426\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fLoRA\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u5148\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5f69\u7968\u5047\u8bbe\u5728LoRA\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u66f4\u591a\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6bcf\u5c42\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u5177\u4f53\u6743\u91cd\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Partial-LoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u548c12\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cPartial-LoRA\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe87%\u7684\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u52a0\u6df1\u4e86\u5bf9\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4ee5\u53ca\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u7a00\u758f\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

While significant efforts have been made to detect and mitigate such hallucinations, predicting whether an LLM's response is correct remains a critical yet underexplored problem. This study investigates the feasibility of predicting correctness by analyzing a general-purpose model (GPT-4o) and a reasoning-centric model (OSS-120B) on a multiple-choice prosthodontics exam. We utilize metadata and hallucination signals across three distinct prompting strategies to build a correctness predictor for each (model, prompting) pair. Our findings demonstrate that this metadata-based approach can improve accuracy by up to +7.14% and achieve a precision of 83.12% over a baseline that assumes all answers are correct. We further show that while actual hallucination is a strong indicator of incorrectness, metadata signals alone are not reliable predictors of hallucination. Finally, we reveal that prompting strategies, despite not affecting overall accuracy, significantly alter the models' internal behaviors and the predictive utility of their metadata. These results present a promising direction for developing reliability signals in LLMs but also highlight that the methods explored in this paper are not yet robust enough for critical, high-stakes deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4f7f\u7528\u5143\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\u9884\u6d4bLLM\u5728\u7259\u79d1\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5e7b\u89c9\uff09\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u9884\u6d4bLLM\u56de\u7b54\u662f\u5426\u6b63\u786e\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u4f46\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-4o\uff09\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\uff08OSS-120B\uff09\u5728\u7259\u79d1\u591a\u9009\u9898\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\uff08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u7ec4\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5143\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5c06\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u6700\u591a+7.14%\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u8fbe\u523083.12%\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u7b54\u6848\u90fd\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff09\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u5e7b\u89c9\u662f\u9519\u8bef\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u5f3a\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4fe1\u53f7\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u867d\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u603b\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1LLM\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u5173\u952e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u90e8\u7f72\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

Task vectors, defined as the difference between fine-tuned and pre-trained model parameters, provide a mechanism for steering neural networks toward desired behaviors. This has given rise to large repositories dedicated to task vectors tailored for specific behaviors. The arithmetic operation of these task vectors allows for the seamless combination of desired behaviors without the need for large datasets. However, these vectors often contain overlapping concepts that can interfere with each other during arithmetic operations, leading to unpredictable outcomes. We propose a principled decomposition method that separates each task vector into two components: one capturing shared knowledge across multiple task vectors, and another isolating information unique to each specific task. By identifying invariant subspaces across projections, our approach enables more precise control over concept manipulation without unintended amplification or diminution of other behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our decomposition method across three domains: improving multi-task merging in image classification by 5% using shared components as additional task vectors, enabling clean style mixing in diffusion models without generation degradation by mixing only the unique components, and achieving 47% toxicity reduction in language models while preserving performance on general knowledge tasks by negating the toxic information isolated to the unique component.

However, the binary and discontinuous nature of spike activations causes vanishing gradients, making adversarial robustness evaluation via gradient descent unreliable. While improved surrogate gradient methods have been proposed, their effectiveness under strong adversarial attacks remains unclear. We propose a more reliable framework for evaluating SNN adversarial robustness. We theoretically analyze the degree of gradient vanishing in surrogate gradients and introduce the Adaptive Sharpness Surrogate Gradient (ASSG), which adaptively evolves the shape of the surrogate function according to the input distribution during attack iterations, thereby enhancing gradient accuracy while mitigating gradient vanishing. In addition, we design an adversarial attack with adaptive step size under the $L_\\infty$ constraint-Stable Adaptive Projected Gradient Descent (SA-PGD), achieving faster and more stable convergence under imprecise gradients. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially increases attack success rates across diverse adversarial training schemes, SNN architectures and neuron models, providing a more generalized and reliable evaluation of SNN adversarial robustness. The experimental results further reveal that the robustness of current SNNs has been significantly overestimated and highlighting the need for more dependable adversarial training methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684SNN\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9510\u5ea6\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6(ASSG)\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d(SA-PGD)\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dSNN\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u88ab\u9ad8\u4f30\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "SNN\u4f7f\u7528\u8109\u51b2\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u62df\u5927\u8111\u9ad8\u6548\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u548c\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u7279\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "1) \u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9510\u5ea6\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6(ASSG)\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u653b\u51fb\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u5e03\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u66ff\u4ee3\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u68af\u5ea6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\uff1b3) \u8bbe\u8ba1L\u221e\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b65\u957f\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u7a33\u5b9a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d(SA-PGD)\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u3001SNN\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u53ef\u9760\u7684SNN\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524dSNN\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u88ab\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aSNN\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709SNN\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, in time-series forecasting, prior work has predominantly focused on encoder design, often treating prediction and training as separate or secondary concerns. In this paper, we propose TimePerceiver, a unified encoder-decoder forecasting framework that is tightly aligned with an effective training strategy. To be specific, we first generalize the forecasting task to include diverse temporal prediction objectives such as extrapolation, interpolation, and imputation. Since this generalization requires handling input and target segments that are arbitrarily positioned along the temporal axis, we design a novel encoder-decoder architecture that can flexibly perceive and adapt to these varying positions. For encoding, we introduce a set of latent bottleneck representations that can interact with all input segments to jointly capture temporal and cross-channel dependencies. For decoding, we leverage learnable queries corresponding to target timestamps to effectively retrieve relevant information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range of benchmark datasets.

In many real systems, the ordering of feature values matters far more than their raw magnitudes - yet the structural conditions that a rank-based normalization operator must satisfy to remain stable under these invariances have never been formally pinned down.\n  We show that widely used differentiable sorting and ranking operators fundamentally fail these criteria. Because they rely on value gaps and batch-level pairwise interactions, they are intrinsically unstable under strictly monotone transformations, shifts in mini-batch composition, and even tiny input perturbations. Crucially, these failures stem from the operators' structural design, not from incidental implementation choices.\n  To address this, we propose three axioms that formalize the minimal invariance and stability properties required of rank-based input normalization. We prove that any operator satisfying these axioms must factor into (i) a feature-wise rank representation and (ii) a scalarization map that is both monotone and Lipschitz-continuous. We then construct a minimal operator that meets these criteria and empirically show that the resulting constraints are non-trivial in realistic setups. Together, our results sharply delineate the design space of valid rank-based normalization operators and formally separate them from existing continuous-relaxation-based sorting methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u6392\u540d\u7b97\u5b50\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u79e9\u57fa\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u7406\u6765\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u79e9\u57fa\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u7b97\u5b50\u3002", "motivation": "\u79e9\u57fa\u8f93\u5165\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u5bf9\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u6279\u6b21\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u91cd\u89c6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u79e9\u57fa\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u5fc5\u987b\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\u4ece\u672a\u88ab\u6b63\u5f0f\u786e\u5b9a\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u6392\u540d\u7b97\u5b50\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u6362\u3001\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u7ec4\u6210\u53d8\u5316\u751a\u81f3\u5fae\u5c0f\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u7406\u6765\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u79e9\u57fa\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4efb\u4f55\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u516c\u7406\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u5fc5\u987b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\uff1a(i) \u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u79e9\u8868\u793a\u548c (ii) \u5355\u8c03\u4e14Lipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u6620\u5c04\u3002\u7136\u540e\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u6392\u540d\u7b97\u5b50\u7531\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u503c\u95f4\u9699\u548c\u6279\u6b21\u7ea7\u6210\u5bf9\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u6362\u3001\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u7ec4\u6210\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5fae\u5c0f\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u672c\u8d28\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u516c\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u79e9\u57fa\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u5212\u5b9a\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u677e\u5f1b\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6b63\u5f0f\u533a\u5206\u5f00\u6765\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u79e9\u57fa\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7b97\u5b50\u5fc5\u987b\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u79e9\u57fa\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6709\u6548\u7684\u79e9\u57fa\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u677e\u5f1b\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6b63\u5f0f\u533a\u5206\u5f00\u6765\u3002"}}

Recently, crash data has increasingly revealed that AV behavior can deviate from expected safety outcomes, raising concerns about the technology's safety and operational reliability in mixed traffic environments. While past research has investigated AV crash, most studies rely on small-size California-centered datasets, with a limited focus on understanding crash trends across various SAE Levels of automation. This study analyzes over 2,500 AV crash records from the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), covering SAE Levels 2 and 4, to uncover underlying crash dynamics. A two-stage data mining framework is developed. K-means clustering is first applied to segment crash records into 4 distinct behavioral clusters based on temporal, spatial, and environmental factors. Then, Association Rule Mining (ARM) is used to extract interpretable multivariate relationships between crash patterns and crash contributors including lighting conditions, surface condition, vehicle dynamics, and environmental conditions within each cluster. These insights provide actionable guidance for AV developers, safety regulators, and policymakers in formulating AV deployment strategies and minimizing crash risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8eNHTSA\u8d85\u8fc72500\u8d77AV\u4e8b\u6545\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u6846\u67b6\uff08K-means\u805a\u7c7b+\u5173\u8054\u89c4\u5219\u6316\u6398\uff09\u5206\u6790SAE 2\u7ea7\u548c4\u7ea7\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u4e8b\u6545\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u867d\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u901a\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e8b\u6545\u6570\u636e\u663e\u793a\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u504f\u79bb\u9884\u671f\u5b89\u5168\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6280\u672f\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u52a0\u5dde\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ea7\u522b\u4e8b\u6545\u8d8b\u52bf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528K-means\u805a\u7c7b\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u7a7a\u548c\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u5c06\u4e8b\u6545\u8bb0\u5f55\u5206\u4e3a4\u4e2a\u884c\u4e3a\u96c6\u7fa4\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u5173\u8054\u89c4\u5219\u6316\u6398\uff08ARM\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u6bcf\u4e2a\u96c6\u7fa4\u5185\u4e8b\u6545\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u7167\u660e\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u8def\u9762\u72b6\u51b5\u3001\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u5143\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u4e8b\u6545\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e2d\u4e8b\u6545\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5404\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3SAE 2\u7ea7\u548c4\u7ea7\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u4e8b\u6545\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5236\u5b9aAV\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e8b\u6545\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e8b\u6545\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4e8b\u6545\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Current learning-based approaches often suffer from a fragmented paradigm: generative models capture diversity but lack reliable energy calibration, whereas deterministic predictors target a single structure and fail to represent ensemble variability. Here we present EnFlow, a unified framework that couples flow matching (FM) with an explicitly learned energy model through an energy-guided sampling scheme defined along a non-Gaussian FM path. By incorporating energy-gradient guidance during sampling, our method steers trajectories toward lower-energy regions, substantially improving conformational fidelity, particularly in the few-step regime. The learned energy function further enables efficient energy-based ranking of generated ensembles for accurate ground-state identification. Extensive experiments on GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs demonstrate that EnFlow simultaneously improves generation metrics with 1--2 ODE-steps and reduces ground-state prediction errors compared with state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "EnFlow\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u91cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u6784\u8c61\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u6001\u6784\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ba1\u9053\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u6784\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u6001\u6784\u8c61\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u800c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u53ea\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u8868\u793a\u96c6\u5408\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "method": "EnFlow\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u91cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u3002\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u80fd\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f7f\u8f68\u8ff9\u5411\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u533a\u57df\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6784\u8c61\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5728GEOM-QM9\u548cGEOM-Drugs\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEnFlow\u57281-2\u4e2aODE\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e0b\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u57fa\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "EnFlow\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u6784\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u6001\u6784\u8c61\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Among them, Bitcoin uses blockchain technology to make transactions secure, transparent, traceable, and immutable. It also exhibits significant price fluctuations and performance, which has attracted substantial attention, especially in financial sectors. Consequently, a wide range of investors and individuals have turned to investing in the cryptocurrency market. One of the most important challenges in economics is price forecasting for future trades. Cryptocurrencies are no exception, and investors are looking for methods to predict prices; various theories and methods have been proposed in this field. This paper presents a new deep model, called \\emph{Parallel Gated Recurrent Units} (PGRU), for cryptocurrency price prediction. In this model, recurrent neural networks forecast prices in a parallel and independent way. The parallel networks utilize different inputs, each representing distinct price-related features. Finally, the outputs of the parallel networks are combined by a neural network to forecast the future price of cryptocurrencies. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of 3.243% and 2.641% for window lengths 20 and 15, respectively. Our method therefore attains higher accuracy and efficiency with fewer input data and lower computational cost compared to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPGRU\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u4ef7\u683c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ec4\u5408\u8f93\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u548c\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u4e1a\u52a1\u73b0\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u5728\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u4f7f\u7528\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6280\u672f\u4f7f\u4ea4\u6613\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d8\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4ef7\u683c\u6ce2\u52a8\u5267\u70c8\uff0c\u5438\u5f15\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u9700\u8981\u9884\u6d4b\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u2014\u2014\u5e76\u884c\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143(PGRU)\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee5\u5e76\u884c\u548c\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u4ef7\u683c\u3002\u5e76\u884c\u7f51\u7edc\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u4ee3\u8868\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ec4\u5408\u5e76\u884c\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u7684\u672a\u6765\u4ef7\u683c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a97\u53e3\u957f\u5ea6\u4e3a20\u548c15\u65f6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863.243%\u548c2.641%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u8bef\u5dee(MAPE)\u3002\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "PGRU\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Due to the inherent complexity and relationship between important economic and political components, accurate forecasting of financial markets has always been challenging. Therefore, providing a model that can accurately predict the future of the markets is very important and will be of great benefit to their developers. In this paper, an artificial intelligence-based algorithm for daily and monthly gold forecasting is presented. Two Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are responsible for daily and monthly forecasting, the results of which are integrated into a Multilayer perceptrons (MLP) network and provide the final forecast of the next day prices. The algorithm forecasts the highest, lowest, and closing prices on the daily and monthly time frame. Based on these forecasts, a trading strategy for live market trading was developed, according to which the proposed model had a return of 171% in three months. Also, the number of internal neurons in each network is optimized by the Gray Wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm based on the least RMSE error. The dataset was collected between 2010 and 2021 and includes data on macroeconomic, energy markets, stocks, and currency status of developed countries.

Standard error feedback, however, relies on client-specific control variates, which violates user privacy and is incompatible with stateless clients common in large-scale FL. This paper proposes two novel frameworks that enable biased compression without client-side state or control variates. The first, Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), uses the globally aggregated update from the previous round as a shared control variate for all clients. The second, Server-Guided Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe-S), extends this idea to scenarios where the server possesses a small private dataset; it generates a server-guided candidate update to be used as a more accurate predictor. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative algorithm and analytically prove CAFe's superiority to Distributed Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-convex regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. We further prove that CAFe-S converges to a stationary point, with a rate that improves as the server's data become more representative. Experimental results in FL scenarios validate the superiority of our approaches over existing compression schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6CAFe\u548cCAFe-S\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u538b\u7f29\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5230\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u4f20\u8f93\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5e26\u5bbd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u504f\u7f6e\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u9700\u8981\u8bef\u5dee\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u53cd\u9988\u4f9d\u8d56\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5b9a\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u65e2\u8fdd\u53cd\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) CAFe\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u4e00\u8f6e\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u5408\u66f4\u65b0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b2) CAFe-S\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u62e5\u6709\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5019\u9009\u66f4\u65b0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660eCAFe\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e26\u504f\u7f6e\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u538b\u7f29\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0cCAFe-S\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5e73\u7a33\u70b9\u4e14\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u968f\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "CAFe\u548cCAFe-S\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u538b\u7f29\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u72b6\u6001\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, many real-world tasks involve multi-stage pipeline whose final outcomes lack verifiable rewards or sufficient data to train robust reward models, making judge-based refinement prone to accumulate error over stages. We propose Selective TTS, a process-based refinement framework that scales inference across different stages in multi-agent pipeline, instead of repeated refinement over time by prior work. By distributing compute across stages and pruning low-quality branches early using process-specific judges, Selective TTS mitigates the judge drift and stabilizes refinement. Grounded in the data science pipeline, we build an end-to-end multi-agent pipeline for generating visually insightful charts and report of given dataset, and design a reliable LLM-based judge model, aligned with human experts (Kendall's \u03c4=0.55). Our proposed selective TTS then improves insight quality under a fixed compute budget, increasing mean scores from 61.64 to 65.86 while reducing variance.

The central contribution is a comparative analysis of quantum and classical generative approaches for modeling this physics-derived latent distribution: we evaluate a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM) and Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) against a classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) baseline. Under our experimental conditions, both quantum models produced samples with lower average minimum distances to the true distribution compared to the LSTM, with the QCBM achieving the most favorable metrics.

While centralized approaches have been extensively studied, decentralized methods remain largely underexplored. We study decentralized multi-task representation learning in which the features share a low-rank structure. We consider multiple tasks, each with a finite number of data samples, where the observations follow a linear model with task-specific parameters. In the decentralized setting, task data are distributed across multiple nodes, and information exchange between nodes is constrained by a communication network. The goal is to recover the underlying feature matrix whose rank is much smaller than both the parameter dimension and the number of tasks. We propose a new alternating projected gradient and minimization algorithm with provable accuracy guarantees. We provide comprehensive characterizations of the time, communication, and sample complexities. Importantly, the communication complexity is independent of the target accuracy, which significantly reduces communication cost compared to prior methods. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical analysis across different dimensions and network topologies, and demonstrate regimes in which decentralized learning outperforms centralized federated approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u5171\u4eab\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u63d0\u53d6\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u5171\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u867d\u7136\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u3001\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6062\u590d\u5e95\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u77e9\u9635\uff08\u5176\u79e9\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u91cf\uff09\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u4ea4\u6362\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8868\u5f81\u3002\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\u662f\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u3002\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u4e8e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8054\u90a6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7279\u6027\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Their underlying geometric properties align well with intuitive concepts such as linear separability, minimum enclosing balls, and subspace projection; and basic calculus provides a toolbox for learning through gradient-based optimization.\n  But is this the only possible choice? In this paper, we study the suitability of a radically different field as an alternative to $\\mathbb{R}$ -- the ultrametric and non-archimedean space of $p$-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_p$. The hierarchical structure of the $p$-adics and their interpretation as infinite strings make them an appealing tool for code theory and hierarchical representation learning. Our exploratory theoretical work establishes the building blocks for classification, regression, and representation learning with the $p$-adics, providing learning models and algorithms. We illustrate how simple Quillian semantic networks can be represented as a compact $p$-adic linear network, a construction which is not possible with the field of reals.

We integrate EAGLE-I outage records (2014-2024) with weather, socio-economic, infrastructure, and seasonal event data. Incorporating social and demographic indicators reveals underlying patterns of community vulnerability and provides a clearer understanding of outage risk during extreme conditions. Four machine learning models (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) are evaluated. Experimental validation is performed on a large-scale dataset covering counties in the lower peninsula of Michigan. Among all models tested, the LSTM network achieves the lowest prediction error.

However, the large quantity of newly proposed architectures, together with often contradictory empirical results, makes it difficult to assess which components contribute significantly to final performance. We aim to make sense of the current design space of deep learning architectures for time series forecasting by discussing the design dimensions and trade-offs that can explain, often unexpected, observed results. This paper discusses the necessity of grounding model design on principles for forecasting groups of time series and how such principles can be applied to current models. In particular, we assess how concepts such as locality and globality apply to recent forecasting architectures. We show that accounting for these aspects can be more relevant for achieving accurate results than adopting specific sequence modeling layers and that simple, well-designed forecasting architectures can often match the state of the art.

Ensuring the reliability and executability of such systems requires validating generated SQL, but most existing approaches focus only on syntactic correctness, with few addressing semantic validation (detecting misalignments between questions and SQL). As a consequence, effective semantic validation still faces two key challenges: capturing both global user intent and SQL structural details, and constructing high-quality fine-grained sub-SQL annotations. To tackle these, we introduce HEROSQL, a hierarchical SQL representation approach that integrates global intent (via Logical Plans, LPs) and local details (via Abstract Syntax Trees, ASTs). To enable better information propagation, we employ a Nested Message Passing Neural Network (NMPNN) to capture inherent relational information in SQL and aggregate schema-guided semantics across LPs and ASTs. Additionally, to generate high-quality negative samples, we propose an AST-driven sub-SQL augmentation strategy, supporting robust optimization of fine-grained semantic inconsistencies. Extensive experiments conducted on Text-to-SQL validation benchmarks (both in-domain and out-of-domain settings) demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average 9.40% improvement of AUPRC and 12.35% of AUROC in identifying semantic inconsistencies. It excels at detecting fine-grained semantic errors, provides large language models with more granular feedback, and ultimately enhances the reliability and interpretability of data querying platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "HEROSQL\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eText-to-SQL\u8bed\u4e49\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5206\u5c42SQL\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u903b\u8f91\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\u6574\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5d4c\u5957\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6355\u83b7SQL\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7AST\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b50SQL\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Text-to-SQL\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8bed\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0eSQL\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\uff09\u3002\u8bed\u4e49\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u83b7\u5168\u5c40\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u548cSQL\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b2\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b50SQL\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHEROSQL\u5206\u5c42SQL\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u903b\u8f91\u8ba1\u5212\uff08LPs\uff09\u6355\u83b7\u5168\u5c40\u610f\u56fe\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\uff08ASTs\uff09\u6355\u83b7\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b3\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u5d4c\u5957\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08NMPNN\uff09\u6355\u83b7SQL\u56fa\u6709\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u5728LP\u548cAST\u95f4\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b4\uff09\u63d0\u51faAST\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b50SQL\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Text-to-SQL\u9a8c\u8bc1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u57df\u5185\u548c\u57df\u5916\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff09\u4e2d\uff0cHEROSQL\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cAUPRC\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53479.40%\uff0cAUROC\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534712.35%\u3002\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HEROSQL\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42SQL\u8868\u793a\u548cNMPNN\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Text-to-SQL\u8bed\u4e49\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Traditional epidemiological studies typically analyze these levels independently, limiting insights into how structural environmental conditions interact with individual-level characteristics to influence health outcomes. In this study, we introduce a micro-macro machine learning framework that integrates (1) individual-level anthropometric and socioeconomic data from NHANES and (2) macro-level structural environment features, including food access, air quality, and socioeconomic vulnerability extracted from USDA and EPA datasets. Four machine learning models Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM were trained to predict obesity using NHANES microdata. XGBoost achieved the strongest performance. A composite environmental vulnerability index (EnvScore) was constructed using normalized indicators from USDA and EPA at the state level. Multi-level comparison revealed strong geographic similarity between states with high environmental burden and the nationally predicted micro-level obesity risk distribution. This demonstrates the feasibility of integrating multi-scale datasets to identify environment-driven disparities in obesity risk.

A promising solution is the use of scale-aware hyperparameters, which can enable direct transfer of optimal HPs from small-scale grid searches to large models with minimal performance loss. To understand the principles governing such transfer strategy, we develop a general conceptual framework for reasoning about HP transfer across scale, characterizing transfer as fast when the suboptimality it induces vanishes asymptotically faster than the finite-scale performance gap. We show formally that fast transfer is equivalent to useful transfer for compute-optimal grid search, meaning that transfer is asymptotically more compute-efficient than direct tuning. While empirical work has found that the Maximal Update Parameterization ($\u03bc$P) exhibits fast transfer when scaling model width, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show that this property depends critically on problem structure by presenting synthetic settings where transfer either offers provable computational advantage or fails to outperform direct tuning even under $\u03bc$P. To explain the fast transfer observed in practice, we conjecture that decomposing the optimization trajectory reveals two contributions to loss reduction: (1) a width-stable component that determines the optimal HPs, and (2) a width-sensitive component that improves with width but weakly perturbs the HP optimum. We present empirical evidence for this hypothesis across various settings, including large language model pretraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8de8\u89c4\u6a21\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u8fc1\u79fb\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u7f51\u683c\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u03bcP\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u65f6\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u8fc1\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u5f97\u8fc7\u4e8e\u6602\u8d35\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u683c\u641c\u7d22\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u76f4\u63a5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8de8\u89c4\u6a21\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\"\u5feb\u901f\u8fc1\u79fb\"\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u7f51\u683c\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u8fc1\u79fb\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u6709\u7528\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u03bcP\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u89e3\u5047\u8bbe\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u8fc1\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u8fc1\u79fb\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u7f51\u683c\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u8c03\u4f18\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u03bcP\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5feb\u901f\u8fc1\u79fb\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u7279\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u89e3\u5047\u8bbe\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8de8\u89c4\u6a21\u8fc1\u79fb\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u03bcP\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u8fc1\u79fb\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u8fc1\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for processing such graphs, but the lack of transparency and explainability limits their practical adoption. Research on TGNN explainability is still in its early stages and faces several key issues: (i) Current methods are tailored to specific TGNN types, restricting generality. (ii) They suffer from high computational costs, making them unsuitable for large-scale networks. (iii) They often overlook the structural connectivity of explanations and require prior knowledge, reducing user-friendliness. To address these issues, we propose GRExplainer, the first universal, efficient, and user-friendly explanation method for TGNNs. GRExplainer extracts node sequences as a unified feature representation, making it independent of specific input formats and thus applicable to both snapshot-based and event-based TGNNs (the major types of TGNNs). By utilizing breadth-first search and temporal information to construct input node sequences, GRExplainer reduces redundant computation and improves efficiency. To enhance user-friendliness, we design a generative model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), enabling automated and continuous explanation generation. Experiments on six real-world datasets with three target TGNNs show that GRExplainer outperforms existing baseline methods in generality, efficiency, and user-friendliness.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRExplainer\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u7684Temporal GNN\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8282\u70b9\u5e8f\u5217\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u3001BFS\u641c\u7d22\u548cRNN\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709TGNN\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "TGNN\u5728\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709TGNN\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9aTGNN\u7c7b\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\uff1b3\uff09\u5ffd\u7565\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGRExplainer\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u8282\u70b9\u5e8f\u5217\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u7167\u578b\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u578bTGNN\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u6784\u5efa\u8f93\u5165\u8282\u70b9\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b3\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8eRNN\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8fde\u7eed\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u57286\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c3\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807TGNN\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGRExplainer\u5728\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GRExplainer\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u7684TGNN\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u5e8f\u5217\u8868\u793a\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709TGNN\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86TGNN\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

The system is defined by three tightly coupled components: (1) a {time-independent wave-energy solver} that treats perception and classification as spectral decomposition under a learned Hamiltonian; (2) a {time-dependent dynamical solver} governing the evolution of semantic wavefunctions over time, enabling context-aware decision revision, re-routing, and reasoning under environmental changes; and (3) a {low-rank operator calculus} that learns symbolic transformations such as modular arithmetic through learned quantum-like transition operators. Together, these components form a coherent physics-driven alternative to conventional cross-entropy training and transformer attention, providing robust generalization, interpretable semantics, and emergent topology.\n  Empirically, Schr\u00f6dinger AI demonstrates: (a) emergent semantic manifolds that reflect human-conceived class relations without explicit supervision; (b) dynamic reasoning that adapts to changing environments, including maze navigation with real-time potential-field perturbations; and (c) exact operator generalization on modular arithmetic tasks, where the system learns group actions and composes them across sequences far beyond training length.

We investigate China based SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns (e.g., infection type and likely transmission source) using publicly released tracking data. We collect case reports from local health commissions, the Chinese CDC, and official local government social media, then apply NLP and manual curation to construct transmission/tracking chains. We further analyze tracking data together with Wuhan population mobility data to quantify and visualize temporal and spatial spread dynamics. Results indicate substantial regional differences, with larger cities showing more infections, likely driven by social activities. Most symptomatic individuals (79\\%) were hospitalized within 5 days of symptom onset, and those with confirmed-case contact sought admission in under 5 days. Infection sources also shifted over time: early cases were largely linked to travel to (or contact with travelers from) Hubei Province, while later transmission was increasingly associated with social activities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u56fdCOVID-19\u4f20\u64ad\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u611f\u67d3\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff08\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u6d3b\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\uff09\uff0c79%\u6709\u75c7\u72b6\u8005\u5728\u75c7\u72b6\u51fa\u73b05\u5929\u5185\u4f4f\u9662\uff0c\u611f\u67d3\u6e90\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece\u6e56\u5317\u65c5\u884c\u76f8\u5173\u8f6c\u5411\u793e\u4f1a\u6d3b\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff08\u5982\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u9694\u79bb\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u8005\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff09\u7684\u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684COVID-19\u7f13\u89e3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u4e2d\u56fdSARS-CoV-2\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u5730\u65b9\u536b\u751f\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u3001\u4e2d\u56fdCDC\u548c\u5730\u65b9\u653f\u5e9c\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u75c5\u4f8b\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u6574\u7406\u6784\u5efa\u4f20\u64ad/\u8ffd\u8e2a\u94fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6b66\u6c49\u4eba\u53e3\u6d41\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5316\u5e76\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f20\u64ad\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u533a\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u5927\u57ce\u5e02\u611f\u67d3\u66f4\u591a\uff08\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u6d3b\u52a8\u9a71\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\uff09\uff1b79%\u6709\u75c7\u72b6\u8005\u5728\u75c7\u72b6\u51fa\u73b05\u5929\u5185\u4f4f\u9662\uff1b\u4e0e\u786e\u8bca\u75c5\u4f8b\u63a5\u89e6\u8005\u57285\u5929\u5185\u5bfb\u6c42\u5165\u9662\uff1b\u611f\u67d3\u6e90\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff1a\u65e9\u671f\u4e3b\u8981\u4e0e\u6e56\u5317\u65c5\u884c\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u66f4\u591a\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u6d3b\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5b58\u5728\u533a\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u793e\u4f1a\u6d3b\u52a8\u662f\u540e\u671f\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u53ca\u65f6\u5c31\u533b\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u8005\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5bf9\u63a7\u5236\u75ab\u60c5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Existing methods predominantly rely on Euclidean distance, failing to adequately account for anisotropic gas feature distributions and dynamic signal intensity variations. To address these issues, this study proposes SNM-Net, a universal deep learning framework for open-set gas recognition. The core innovation lies in a geometric decoupling mechanism achieved through cascaded batch normalization and L2 normalization, which projects high-dimensional features onto a unit hypersphere to eliminate signal intensity fluctuations. Additionally, Mahalanobis distance is introduced as the scoring mechanism, utilizing class-wise statistics to construct adaptive ellipsoidal decision boundaries. SNM-Net is architecture-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with CNN, RNN, and Transformer backbones. Systematic experiments on the Vergara dataset demonstrate that the Transformer+SNM configuration attains near-theoretical performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.9977 and an unknown gas detection rate of 99.57% (TPR at 5% FPR). This performance significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing a 3.0% improvement in AUROC and a 91.0% reduction in standard deviation compared to Class Anchor Clustering.

In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning based distillation framework for diffusion models. Instead of relying on fixed reconstruction or consistency losses, we treat the distillation process as a policy optimization problem, where the student is trained using a reward signal derived from alignment with the teacher's outputs. This RL driven approach dynamically guides the student to explore multiple denoising paths, allowing it to take longer, optimized steps toward high-probability regions of the data distribution, rather than relying on incremental refinements. Our framework utilizes the inherent ability of diffusion models to handle larger steps and effectively manage the generative process. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance with significantly fewer inference steps and computational resources compared to existing distillation techniques.

In Phase 2, the ensemble is distilled into a larger network and fine-tuned with standard Double DQN. We prove theoretically that satisficing induces bounded updates and cannot increase target variance, with a corollary quantifying conditions for substantial reduction. Empirically, Sat-EnQ achieves 3.8x variance reduction, eliminates catastrophic failures (0% vs 50% for DQN), maintains 79% performance under environmental noise}, and requires 2.5x less compute than bootstrapped ensembles.

Supervised fine-tuning and many distillation-style objectives implicitly minimize the forward KL divergence KL(q || pi_theta), yielding stable mode-covering updates but often under-exploiting high-reward modes.

Recent anchored methods, such as ADPO, show that performing the projection in anchored coordinates can substantially improve stability, yet they typically commit to a single divergence.

Martin", "Noah Brenowitz", "Dale Durran", "Michael Pritchard"], "title": "Long-Range Distillation: Distilling 10,000 Years of Simulated Climate into Long Timestep AI Weather Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Accurate long-range weather forecasting remains a major challenge for AI models, both because errors accumulate over autoregressive rollouts and because reanalysis datasets used for training offer a limited sample of the slow modes of climate variability underpinning predictability. Most AI weather models are autoregressive, producing short lead forecasts that must be repeatedly applied to reach subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) or seasonal lead times, often resulting in instability and calibration issues. Long-timestep probabilistic models that generate long-range forecasts in a single step offer an attractive alternative, but training on the 40-year reanalysis record leads to overfitting, suggesting orders of magnitude more training data are required. We introduce long-range distillation, a method that trains a long-timestep probabilistic \"student\" model to forecast directly at long-range using a huge synthetic training dataset generated by a short-timestep autoregressive \"teacher\" model. Using the Deep Learning Earth System Model (DLESyM) as the teacher, we generate over 10,000 years of simulated climate to train distilled student models for forecasting across a range of timescales. In perfect-model experiments, the distilled models outperform climatology and approach the skill of their autoregressive teacher while replacing hundreds of autoregressive steps with a single timestep.

Prior work has shown that this off-policy mismatch is unavoidable in modern LLM-RL due to implementation divergence, mixture-of-experts routing discontinuities, and distributed training staleness. Classical trust region bounds on the resulting error scale as $O(T^2)$ with sequence length $T$, rendering them vacuous for long-horizon tasks. We derive two tighter bounds: a Pinsker-Marginal bound scaling as $O(T^{3/2})$ and a Mixed bound scaling as $O(T)$. Crucially, both bounds depend on $D_{kl}^{tok,max}$ -- the maximum token-level KL divergence across all positions in a sequence. This is inherently a sequence-level quantity: it requires examining the entire trajectory to compute, and therefore cannot be controlled by token-independent methods like PPO clipping.

However, uniform goal selection often results in sample inefficiency in multi-goal settings where agents must learn a universal goal-conditioned policy. Inspired by the adaptive and structured learning processes observed in biological systems, we propose a novel Student-Teacher learning paradigm with a Temporal Variance-Driven Curriculum to accelerate Goal-Conditioned RL. In this framework, the teacher module dynamically prioritizes goals with the highest temporal variance in the policy's confidence score, parameterized by the state-action value (Q) function. The teacher provides an adaptive and focused learning signal by targeting these high-uncertainty goals, fostering continual and efficient progress. We establish a theoretical connection between the temporal variance of Q-values and the evolution of the policy, providing insights into the method's underlying principles. Our approach is algorithm-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with existing RL frameworks. We demonstrate this through evaluation across 11 diverse robotic manipulation and maze navigation tasks.

Learning such joint dynamics is further complicated by the scarcity and subjectivity of affective annotations, which motivates the use of self-supervised learning (SSL). However, most existing SSL approaches rely on pairwise alignment objectives, which are insufficient to characterize dependencies among more than two modalities and fail to capture higher-order interactions arising from coordinated brain and autonomic responses.\n  To address this limitation, we propose Multimodal Functional Maximum Correlation (MFMC), a principled SSL framework that maximizes higher-order multimodal dependence through a Dual Total Correlation (DTC) objective. By deriving a tight sandwich bound and optimizing it using a functional maximum correlation analysis (FMCA) based trace surrogate, MFMC captures joint multimodal interactions directly, without relying on pairwise contrastive losses.\n  Experiments on three public affective computing benchmarks demonstrate that MFMC consistently achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance under both subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluation protocols, highlighting its robustness to inter-subject variability. In particular, MFMC improves subject-dependent accuracy on CEAP-360VR from 78.9% to 86.8%, and subject-independent accuracy from 27.5% to 33.1% using the EDA signal alone. Moreover, MFMC remains within 0.8 percentage points of the best-performing method on the most challenging EEG subject-independent split of MAHNOB-HCI.

We present an in-depth study of the target loss estimation error relative to the surrogate loss estimation error. Our analysis leads to $H$-consistency bounds, which are guarantees accounting for the hypothesis set $H$. These bounds offer stronger guarantees than Bayes-consistency or $H$-calibration and are more informative than excess error bounds.\n  We begin with binary classification, establishing tight distribution-dependent and -independent bounds. We provide explicit bounds for convex surrogates (including linear models and neural networks) and analyze the adversarial setting for surrogates like $\u03c1$-margin and sigmoid loss. Extending to multi-class classification, we present the first $H$-consistency bounds for max, sum, and constrained losses, covering both non-adversarial and adversarial scenarios. We demonstrate that in some cases, non-trivial $H$-consistency bounds are unattainable. We also investigate comp-sum losses (e.g., cross-entropy, MAE), deriving their first $H$-consistency bounds and introducing smooth adversarial variants that yield robust learning algorithms.\n  We develop a comprehensive framework for deriving these bounds across various surrogates, introducing new characterizations for constrained and comp-sum losses. Finally, we examine the growth rates of $H$-consistency bounds, establishing a universal square-root growth rate for smooth surrogates in binary and multi-class tasks, and analyze minimizability gaps to guide surrogate selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faH-\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7406\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u6bd4\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6216H-\u6821\u51c6\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u6bd4\u8d85\u989d\u8bef\u5dee\u8fb9\u754c\u66f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5e38\u56e0\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u6027\u800c\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u635f\u5931\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u8005\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acbH-\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u51f8\u4ee3\u7406\u635f\u5931\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7ea6\u675f\u635f\u5931\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5e73\u6ed1\u5bf9\u6297\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u589e\u957f\u7387\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u5206\u5e03\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u72ec\u7acb\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4e3a\u6700\u5927\u635f\u5931\u3001\u6c42\u548c\u635f\u5931\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u635f\u5931\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u635f\u5931\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2aH-\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0d\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5e73\u6ed1\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u589e\u957f\u901f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "H-\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u635f\u5931\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u53ef\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u4ee3\u7406\u635f\u5931\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

We prove this mismatch has an asymmetric effect: the bound on log-probability mismatch scales as $(1-p)$ where $p$ is the token probability. For high-probability tokens, this bound vanishes, contributing negligibly to sequence-level mismatch. For low-probability tokens in the tail, the bound remains large, and moreover, when sampled, these tokens exhibit systematically biased mismatches that accumulate over sequences, destabilizing gradient estimation. Rather than applying post-hoc corrections, we propose constraining the RL objective to a dynamically-pruned ``safe'' vocabulary that excludes the extreme tail. By pruning such tokens, we trade large, systematically biased mismatches for a small, bounded optimization bias.

Leveraging multiple experts offers a solution: deferring uncertain inputs to more capable experts improves reliability, while routing simpler queries to smaller, distilled models enhances efficiency. This motivates the problem of learning with multiple-expert deferral. This thesis presents a comprehensive study of this problem and the related problem of learning with abstention, supported by strong consistency guarantees.\n  First, for learning with abstention (a special case of deferral), we analyze score-based and predictor-rejector formulations in multi-class classification. We introduce new families of surrogate losses and prove strong non-asymptotic, hypothesis set-specific consistency guarantees, resolving two existing open questions. We analyze both single-stage and practical two-stage settings, with experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithms.\n  Second, we address general multi-expert deferral in classification. We design new surrogate losses for both single-stage and two-stage scenarios and prove they benefit from strong $H$-consistency bounds. For the two-stage scenario, we show that our surrogate losses are realizable $H$-consistent for constant cost functions, leading to effective new algorithms.\n  Finally, we introduce a novel framework for regression with deferral to address continuous label spaces.

However, most existing models are designed for centralized settings, rendering them inapplicable in modern decentralized environments. Moreover, current federated learning approaches often suffer from poor generalization performance due to reliance on unreliable pseudo-labels, and fail to capture the latent correlations amongst heterogeneous clients. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework named Federated Multi-Task Clustering (i.e.,FMTC), which intends to learn personalized clustering models for heterogeneous clients while collaboratively leveraging their shared underlying structure in a privacy-preserving manner. More specifically, the FMTC framework is composed of two main components: client-side personalized clustering module, which learns a parameterized mapping model to support robust out-of-sample inference, bypassing the need for unreliable pseudo-labels; and server-side tensorial correlation module, which explicitly captures the shared knowledge across all clients. This is achieved by organizing all client models into a unified tensor and applying a low-rank regularization to discover their common subspace. To solve this joint optimization problem, we derive an efficient, privacy-preserving distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, which decomposes the global problem into parallel local updates on clients and an aggregation step on the server. To the end, several extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed FMTC framework significantly outperforms various baseline and state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "FMTC\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8054\u90a6\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u805a\u7c7b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u5f20\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u805a\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u6355\u83b7\u5171\u4eab\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u73af\u5883\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5f02\u6784\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFMTC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u805a\u7c7b\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6620\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6837\u672c\u5916\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u5f20\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u5f20\u91cf\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53d1\u73b0\u516c\u5171\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff09\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eADMM\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5e76\u884c\u672c\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u805a\u5408\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFMTC\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FMTC\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u77e5\u8bc6\u6355\u83b7\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Uniform Convergence Bounds for Generative & Vision-Language Models under Low-Dimensional Structure", "comment": "13 pages, 2 figures", "summary": "Modern generative and vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in scientific and medical decision support, where predicted probabilities must be both accurate and well calibrated. Despite strong empirical results with moderate data, it remains unclear when such predictions generalize uniformly across inputs, classes, or subpopulations, rather than only on average-a critical issue in biomedicine, where rare conditions and specific groups can exhibit large errors even when overall loss is low.\n  We study this question from a finite-sample perspective and ask: under what structural assumptions can generative and VLM-based predictors achieve uniformly accurate and calibrated behavior with practical sample sizes? Rather than analyzing arbitrary parameterizations, we focus on induced families of classifiers obtained by varying prompts or semantic embeddings within a restricted representation space. When model outputs depend smoothly on a low-dimensional semantic representation-an assumption supported by spectral structure in text and joint image-text embeddings-classical uniform convergence tools yield meaningful non-asymptotic guarantees.\n  Our main results give finite-sample uniform convergence bounds for accuracy and calibration functionals of VLM-induced classifiers under Lipschitz stability with respect to prompt embeddings. The implied sample complexity depends on intrinsic/effective dimension, not ambient embedding dimension, and we further derive spectrum-dependent bounds that make explicit how eigenvalue decay governs data requirements. We conclude with implications for data-limited biomedical modeling, including when current dataset sizes can support uniformly reliable predictions and why average calibration metrics may miss worst-case miscalibration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5747\u5300\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u4f55\u65f6\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u6821\u51c6\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u7f55\u89c1\u60c5\u51b5\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u7528\u4e8e\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u65e2\u51c6\u786e\u53c8\u6821\u51c6\u826f\u597d\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9884\u6d4b\u4f55\u65f6\u80fd\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u6216\u4e9a\u7fa4\u4e4b\u95f4\u5747\u5300\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u5e73\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002\u8fd9\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u4e2d\u5c24\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7f55\u89c1\u60c5\u51b5\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u7fa4\u4f53\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u603b\u4f53\u635f\u5931\u8f83\u4f4e\u65f6\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u8f83\u5927\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u65cf\u3002\u5047\u8bbe\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5e73\u6ed1\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff08\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u5f97\u5230\u6587\u672c\u548c\u8054\u5408\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff09\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u5747\u5300\u6536\u655b\u5de5\u5177\u83b7\u5f97\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3aVLM\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6cdb\u51fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u5747\u5300\u6536\u655b\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fb9\u754c\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u5d4c\u5165\u7684Lipschitz\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5185\u5728/\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u73af\u5883\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u8c31\u76f8\u5173\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u8870\u51cf\u5982\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u4f55\u65f6\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u5747\u5300\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5e73\u5747\u6821\u51c6\u6307\u6807\u53ef\u80fd\u9057\u6f0f\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e9a\u7fa4\u4e2d\u5747\u5300\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, this presents three key system challenges - model architecture diversity, kernel primitive diversity, and hardware generation and architecture heterogeneity. This paper presents KernelEvolve-an agentic kernel coding framework-to tackle heterogeneity at-scale for DLRM. KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale.

So far, many research works have used deep learning models to explore the complex interactions between students, questions, and skills. However, the performance of existing method is frequently limited by the long-tailed distribution and dynamic changes in the data. To address these challenges, we propose a meta-learning framework for cognitive diagnosis based on continual learning (MetaCD). This framework can alleviate the long-tailed problem by utilizing meta-learning to learn the optimal initialization state, enabling the model to achieve good accuracy on new tasks with only a small amount of data.

Proceedings publication pending", "summary": "Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices is challenging due to their limited memory and power resources. Cloud-only inference reduces device burden but introduces high latency and cost. Static edge-cloud partitions optimize a single metric and struggle when bandwidth fluctuates. We propose Splitwise, a novel Lyapunov-assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for fine-grained, adaptive partitioning of LLMs across edge and cloud environments. Splitwise decomposes transformer layers into attention heads and feed-forward sub-blocks, exposing more partition choices than layer-wise schemes. A hierarchical DRL policy, guided by Lyapunov optimization, jointly minimizes latency, energy consumption, and accuracy degradation while guaranteeing queue stability under stochastic workloads and variable network bandwidth. Splitwise also guarantees robustness via partition checkpoints with exponential backoff recovery in case of communication failures. Experiments on Jetson Orin NX, Galaxy S23, and Raspberry Pi 5 with GPT-2 (1.5B), LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA-13B show that Splitwise reduces end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.8x and cuts energy consumption by up to 41% compared with existing partitioners. It lowers the 95th-percentile latency by 53-61% relative to cloud-only execution, while maintaining accuracy and modest memory requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "Splitwise\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eLyapunov\u8f85\u52a9\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684LLM\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06Transformer\u5c42\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u548c\u524d\u9988\u5b50\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf1.4-2.8\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe41%", "motivation": "\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u529f\u8017\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7eaf\u4e91\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u5927\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6848\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5e26\u5bbd\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSplitwise\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06Transformer\u5c42\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u548c\u524d\u9988\u5b50\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u5c42\u7ea7\u5206\u5272\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5206\u5272\u9009\u62e9\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528Lyapunov\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9000\u5316\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u533a\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u548c\u6307\u6570\u9000\u907f\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u8bc1\u901a\u4fe1\u6545\u969c\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "result": "\u5728Jetson Orin NX\u3001Galaxy S23\u548cRaspberry Pi 5\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5GPT-2\uff081.5B\uff09\u3001LLaMA-7B\u548cLLaMA-13B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5272\u5668\uff1a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e1.4-2.8\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe41%\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eaf\u4e91\u6267\u884c\uff1a95%\u5206\u4f4d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e53-61%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42", "conclusion": "Splitwise\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

However, the capabilities of any single LLM are inherently bounded. One solution originates from intricate interactions among multiple LLMs, rendering their collective performance surpasses that of any constituent model. Despite the rapid proliferation of multi-model integration techniques such as model routing and post-hoc ensembling, a unifying theoretical framework of performance scaling for multi-model collaboration remains absent. In this work, we propose the Law of Multi-model Collaboration, a scaling law that predicts the performance limits of LLM ensembles based on their aggregated parameter budget. To quantify the intrinsic upper bound of multi-model collaboration, we adopt a method-agnostic formulation and assume an idealized integration oracle where the total cross-entropy loss of each sample is determined by the minimum loss of any model in the model pool. Experimental results reveal that multi-model systems follow a power-law scaling with respect to the total parameter count, exhibiting a more significant improvement trend and a lower theoretical loss floor compared to single model scaling. Moreover, ensembles of heterogeneous model families achieve better performance scaling than those formed within a single model family, indicating that model diversity is a primary driver of collaboration gains. These findings suggest that model collaboration represents a critical axis for extending the intelligence frontier of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u9075\u5faa\u5e42\u5f8b\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8d8b\u52bf\u6bd4\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u7f29\u653e\u66f4\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662f\u534f\u4f5c\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d85\u8d8a\u4efb\u4f55\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u6280\u672f\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\"\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u5b9a\u5f8b\"\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u7b97\u9884\u6d4bLLM\u96c6\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u6781\u9650\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u603b\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u7531\u6a21\u578b\u6c60\u4e2d\u4efb\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u635f\u5931\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u603b\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u9075\u5faa\u5e42\u5f8b\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u7f29\u653e\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u9650\u3002\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6bd4\u540c\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7f29\u653e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u662f\u6269\u5c55LLM\u667a\u80fd\u524d\u6cbf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662f\u534f\u4f5c\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u7f29\u653e\u9650\u5236\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Prior methods based on latent state compressibility can be invasive and unstable. We propose Multiple Token Divergence (MTD), a simple measure of computational effort defined as the KL divergence between a model's full output distribution and that of a shallow, auxiliary prediction head. MTD can be computed directly from pre-trained models with multiple prediction heads, requiring no additional training. Building on this, we introduce Divergence Steering, a novel decoding method to control the computational character of generated text.

A key limitation of many model architectures is the implicit entanglement of morphological waveform patterns and rhythm dynamics, which can promote shortcut learning and amplify sensitivity to distribution shifts. We propose ECG-RAMBA, a framework that separates morphology and rhythm and then re-integrates them through context-aware fusion. ECG-RAMBA combines: (i) deterministic morphological features extracted by MiniRocket, (ii) global rhythm descriptors computed from heart-rate variability (HRV), and (iii) long-range contextual modeling via a bi-directional Mamba backbone. To improve sensitivity to transient abnormalities under windowed inference, we introduce a numerically stable Power Mean pooling operator ($Q=3$) that emphasizes high-evidence segments while avoiding the brittleness of max pooling and the dilution of averaging. We evaluate under a protocol-faithful setting with subject-level cross-validation, a fixed decision threshold, and no test-time adaptation. On the Chapman--Shaoxing dataset, ECG-RAMBA achieves a macro ROC-AUC $\\approx 0.85$. In zero-shot transfer, it attains PR-AUC $=0.708$ for atrial fibrillation detection on the external CPSC-2021 dataset, substantially outperforming a comparable raw-signal Mamba baseline, and shows consistent cross-dataset performance on PTB-XL. Ablation studies indicate that deterministic morphology provides a strong foundation, while explicit rhythm modeling and long-range context are critical drivers of cross-domain robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "ECG-RAMBA\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u548c\u8282\u5f8b\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u878d\u5408\u7684ECG\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5355\u4e2aECG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u91c7\u96c6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u9690\u542b\u5730\u7ea0\u7f20\u5f62\u6001\u6ce2\u5f62\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u8282\u5f8b\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6377\u5f84\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faECG-RAMBA\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528MiniRocket\u63d0\u53d6\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2) \u4ece\u5fc3\u7387\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u5168\u5c40\u8282\u5f8b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411Mamba\u4e3b\u5e72\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b4) \u5f15\u5165\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684Power Mean\u6c60\u5316\u7b97\u5b50(Q=3)\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u77ac\u6001\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728Chapman-Shaoxing\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5b8f\u89c2ROC-AUC\u22480.85\uff1b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728CPSC-2021\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u623f\u98a4\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684PR-AUC=0.708\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u4fe1\u53f7Mamba\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u5728PTB-XL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u800c\u663e\u5f0f\u8282\u5f8b\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u662f\u8de8\u57df\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002ECG-RAMBA\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u878d\u5408\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u8282\u5f8b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86ECG\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While these CoT modes enhance reasoning capabilities, their generation of extended reasoning traces introduces substantial memory and latency overheads, posing challenges for practical deployment on Ascend NPUs. This paper addresses these computational constraints by leveraging low-bit quantization, which transforms FP16 computations into more efficient integer arithmetic. We introduce a unified low-bit inference framework, supporting INT8 (W8A8) and W4A8 quantization, specifically optimized for openPangu-Embedded models on the Atlas A2. Our comprehensive evaluation, conducted across all three CoT modes on code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and MBPP), demonstrates the efficacy of this approach. INT8 quantization consistently preserves over 90\\% of the FP16 baseline accuracy and achieves a 1.5x prefill speedup on the Atlas A2. Furthermore, W4A8 quantization significantly reduces memory consumption, albeit with a moderate trade-off in accuracy.

Depending on the source of log data collection, various information is recorded in logs that can be considered log modalities. In light of this intuition, unimodal methods often struggle by ignoring the different modalities of log data. Meanwhile, multimodal methods fail to handle the interactions between these modalities. Applying multimodal sentiment analysis to log anomaly detection, we propose CoLog, a framework that collaboratively encodes logs utilizing various modalities. CoLog utilizes collaborative transformers and multi-head impressed attention to learn interactions among several modalities, ensuring comprehensive anomaly detection. To handle the heterogeneity caused by these interactions, CoLog incorporates a modality adaptation layer, which adapts the representations from different log modalities. This methodology enables CoLog to learn nuanced patterns and dependencies within the data, enhancing its anomaly detection capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoLog's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in detecting both point and collective anomalies, CoLog achieves a mean precision of 99.63%, a mean recall of 99.59%, and a mean F1 score of 99.61% across seven benchmark datasets for log-based anomaly detection. The comprehensive detection capabilities of CoLog make it highly suitable for cybersecurity, system monitoring, and operational efficiency. CoLog represents a significant advancement in log anomaly detection, providing a sophisticated and effective solution to point and collective anomaly detection through a unified framework and a solution to the complex challenges automatic log data analysis poses.

This study focuses on single-channel electroencephalography (EEG), a practical and widely available signal for automatic sleep staging. Existing approaches face challenges such as class imbalance, limited receptive-field modeling, and insufficient interpretability. This work proposes a context-aware and interpretable framework for single-channel EEG sleep staging, with particular emphasis on improving detection of the N1 stage. Many prior models operate as black boxes with stacked layers, lacking clearly defined and interpretable feature extraction roles.The proposed model combines compact multi-scale feature extraction with temporal modeling to capture both local and long-range dependencies. To address data imbalance, especially in the N1 stage, classweighted loss functions and data augmentation are applied. EEG signals are segmented into sub-epoch chunks, and final predictions are obtained by averaging softmax probabilities across chunks, enhancing contextual representation and robustness.The proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy of 89.72% and a macro-average F1-score of 85.46%. Notably, it attains an F1- score of 61.7% for the challenging N1 stage, demonstrating a substantial improvement over previous methods on the SleepEDF datasets.

This limitation effectively overlooks \"Familial models, a transformative paradigm essential for realizing ubiquitous intelligence across heterogeneous device-edge-cloud hierarchies. Transcending static architectures, familial models integrate early exits with relay-style inference to spawn G deployable sub-models from a single shared backbone. In this work, we theoretically and empirically extend the scaling law to capture this \"one-run, many-models\" paradigm by introducing Granularity (G) as a fundamental scaling variable alongside model size (N) and training tokens (D). To rigorously quantify this relationship, we propose a unified functional form L(N, D, G) and parameterize it using large-scale empirical runs. Specifically, we employ a rigorous IsoFLOP experimental design to strictly isolate architectural impact from computational scale. Across fixed budgets, we systematically sweep model sizes (N) and granularities (G) while dynamically adjusting tokens (D). This approach effectively decouples the marginal cost of granularity from the benefits of scale, ensuring high-fidelity parameterization of our unified scaling law. Our results reveal that the granularity penalty follows a multiplicative power law with an extremely small exponent. Theoretically, this bridges fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures. Practically, it validates the \"train once, deploy many\" paradigm, demonstrating that deployment flexibility is achievable without compromising the compute-optimality of dense baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5bb6\u65cf\u6a21\u578b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7c92\u5ea6(G)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5f62\u5f0fL(N,D,G)\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5bb6\u65cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u90e8\u7f72\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5bb6\u65cf\u6a21\u578b\u8fd9\u79cd\"\u4e00\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u591a\u6b21\u90e8\u7f72\"\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u5bb6\u65cf\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u548c\u4e2d\u7ee7\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u5171\u4eab\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u8bbe\u5907-\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u666e\u9002\u667a\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0fL(N,D,G)\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7c92\u5ea6(G)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e25\u683c\u7684IsoFLOP\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u626b\u63cf\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f(N)\u548c\u7c92\u5ea6(G)\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee4\u724c\u6570(D)\uff0c\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u7c92\u5ea6\u8fb9\u9645\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u89c4\u6a21\u6548\u76ca\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fd0\u884c\u5bf9\u5b9a\u5f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u7c92\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u9075\u5faa\u4e58\u6027\u5e42\u5f8b\uff0c\u4e14\u6307\u6570\u6781\u5c0f\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff0c\u8fd9\u6865\u63a5\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u67b6\u6784\uff1b\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0a\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\"\u4e00\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u591a\u6b21\u90e8\u7f72\"\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u90e8\u7f72\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u5bc6\u96c6\u57fa\u7ebf\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5bb6\u65cf\u6a21\u578b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u90e8\u7f72\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5171\u5b58\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u7684\u666e\u9002\u667a\u80fd\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

We propose a Simple Baseline for Multimodal Learning (SimBaMM), a straightforward late-fusion Transformer architecture, and demonstrate that under standardized experimental conditions with rigorous hyperparameter tuning of all methods, more complex architectures do not reliably outperform SimBaMM. Statistical analysis indicates that more complex methods perform comparably to SimBaMM and frequently do not reliably outperform well-tuned unimodal baselines, especially in the small-data regime considered in many original studies. To support our findings, we include a case study of a recent multimodal learning method highlighting the methodological shortcomings in the literature.

Current Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) continual learning techniques often retain and freeze previously learned LoRAs or generate data representations to overcome forgetting, typically utilizing these to support new LoRAs learn new tasks. However, these methods not only ignore growing computational memory with tasks and limited storage space but also suffer from potential task interference due to the lack of effective LoRA merging mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel continual learning method that orthogonally initializes and sequentially merges LoRAs updates into a single unified LoRA. Our method leverages orthogonal basis extraction from previously learned LoRA to initialize the learning of new tasks, further exploits the intrinsic asymmetry property of LoRA components by using a time-aware scaling mechanism to balance new and old knowledge during continual merging. Our approach maintains constant memory complexity with respect to the number of tasks, minimizes interference between past and new tasks via orthogonal basis initialization, and improves performance over asymmetric LoRA merging via adaptive scaling. We provide theoretical analysis to justify our design and conduct extensive experiments across diverse continual learning benchmarks using various Llama models, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u5408\u5e76LoRA\u66f4\u65b0\u5230\u5355\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00LoRA\u4e2d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5185\u5b58\u589e\u957f\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LoRA\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u968f\u4efb\u52a1\u589e\u957f\u3001\u5b58\u50a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u6709\u9650\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548LoRA\u5408\u5e76\u673a\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u6b63\u4ea4\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u987a\u5e8f\u5408\u5e76LoRA\u66f4\u65b0\u5230\u5355\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00LoRA\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7f29\u653e\u673a\u5236\u5e73\u8861\u65b0\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u6052\u5b9a\u5185\u5b58\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f29\u653e\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u5408\u5e76LoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd"}}

However, RM training data is commonly recognized as low-quality, containing inductive biases that can easily lead to overfitting and reward hacking. For example, more detailed and comprehensive responses are usually human-preferred but with more words, leading response length to become one of the inevitable inductive biases. A limited number of prior RM debiasing approaches either target a single specific type of bias or model the problem with only simple linear correlations, \\textit{e.g.}, Pearson coefficients. To mitigate more complex and diverse inductive biases in reward modeling, we introduce a novel information-theoretic debiasing method called \\textbf{D}ebiasing via \\textbf{I}nformation optimization for \\textbf{R}M (DIR). Inspired by the information bottleneck (IB), we maximize the mutual information (MI) between RM scores and human preference pairs, while minimizing the MI between RM outputs and biased attributes of preference inputs. With theoretical justification from information theory, DIR can handle more sophisticated types of biases with non-linear correlations, broadly extending the real-world application scenarios for RM debiasing methods. In experiments, we verify the effectiveness of DIR with three types of inductive biases: \\textit{response length}, \\textit{sycophancy}, and \\textit{format}. We discover that DIR not only effectively mitigates target inductive biases but also enhances RLHF performance across diverse benchmarks, yielding better generalization abilities.

While this accuracy loss is well-documented, the internal mechanistic causes remain a black box. This paper investigates the canonical FedAvg algorithm through the lens of Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) to diagnose this failure mode. We hypothesize that the aggregation of conflicting client updates leads to circuit collapse, the destructive interference of functional, sparse sub-networks responsible for specific class predictions. By training inherently interpretable, weight-sparse neural networks within an FL framework, we identify and track these circuits across clients and communication rounds. Using Intersection-over-Union (IoU) to quantify circuit preservation, we provide the first mechanistic evidence that Non-IID data distributions cause structurally distinct local circuits to diverge, leading to their degradation in the global model.

Among them, approaches like LoRA aim to strike a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, but often suffer from slow convergence and limited adaptation capacity due to their inherent low-rank constraints. This trade-off hampers the ability of PEFT methods to capture complex patterns needed for diverse tasks. To address these challenges, we propose FRoD, a novel fine-tuning method that combines hierarchical joint decomposition with rotational degrees of freedom. By extracting a globally shared basis across layers and injecting sparse, learnable perturbations into scaling factors for flexible full-rank updates, FRoD enhances expressiveness and efficiency, leading to faster and more robust convergence. On 20 benchmarks spanning vision, reasoning, and language understanding, FRoD matches full model fine-tuning in accuracy, while using only 1.72% of trainable parameters under identical training budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "FRoD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u8054\u5408\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75281.72%\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LoRA\uff09\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "FRoD\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5c42\u8054\u5408\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u65cb\u8f6c\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u8de8\u5c42\u5168\u5c40\u5171\u4eab\u57fa\uff0c\u5e76\u5411\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u6ce8\u5165\u7a00\u758f\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5168\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6db5\u76d6\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u768420\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFRoD\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75281.72%\u7684\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "FRoD\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing multi-operator learning approaches are data-hungry and neglect physics during training. Here, we propose a physics-informed multimodal foundation model (PI-MFM) framework that directly enforces governing equations during pretraining and adaptation. PI-MFM takes symbolic representations of PDEs as the input, and automatically assembles PDE residual losses from the input expression via a vectorized derivative computation. These designs enable any PDE-encoding multimodal foundation model to be trained or adapted with unified physics-informed objectives across equation families. On a benchmark of 13 parametric one-dimensional time-dependent PDE families, PI-MFM consistently outperforms purely data-driven counterparts, especially with sparse labeled spatiotemporal points, partially observed time domains, or few labeled function pairs. Physics losses further improve robustness against noise, and simple strategies such as resampling collocation points substantially improve accuracy. We also analyze the accuracy, precision, and computational cost of automatic differentiation and finite differences for derivative computation within PI-MFM. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot physics-informed fine-tuning to unseen PDE families: starting from a physics-informed pretrained model, adapting using only PDE residuals and initial/boundary conditions, without any labeled solution data, rapidly reduces test errors to around 1% and clearly outperforms physics-only training from scratch.

Widely used capability leaderboards do not translate directly into deployment decisions, creating a capability--deployment gap; to bridge it, we take a systems-level view in which model choice is tied to application outcomes, operating constraints, and a capability--cost frontier. We develop ML Compass, a framework that treats model selection as constrained optimization over this frontier. On the theory side, we characterize optimal model configurations under a parametric frontier and show a three-regime structure in optimal internal measures: some dimensions are pinned at compliance minima, some saturate at maximum levels, and the remainder take interior values governed by frontier curvature. We derive comparative statics that quantify how budget changes, regulatory tightening, and technological progress propagate across capability dimensions and costs. On the implementation side, we propose a pipeline that (i) extracts low-dimensional internal measures from heterogeneous model descriptors, (ii) estimates an empirical frontier from capability and cost data, (iii) learns a user- or task-specific utility function from interaction outcome data, and (iv) uses these components to target capability--cost profiles and recommend models. We validate ML Compass with two case studies: a general-purpose conversational setting using the PRISM Alignment dataset and a healthcare setting using a custom dataset we build using HealthBench. In both environments, our framework produces recommendations -- and deployment-aware leaderboards based on predicted deployment value under constraints -- that can differ materially from capability-only rankings, and clarifies how trade-offs between capability, cost, and safety shape optimal model choice.", "AI": {"tldr": "ML Compass\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u89c6\u4e3a\u80fd\u529b-\u6210\u672c\u524d\u6cbf\u4e0a\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3AI\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b-\u90e8\u7f72\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u7528\u6237\u6548\u7528\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6392\u884c\u699c\u4e0d\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u90e8\u7f72\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u529b-\u90e8\u7f72\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5728\u9009\u62e9AI\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u7528\u6237\u6548\u7528\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faML Compass\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u89c6\u4e3a\u80fd\u529b-\u6210\u672c\u524d\u6cbf\u4e0a\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u9762\uff1a\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u524d\u6cbf\u4e0b\u523b\u753b\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e09\u533a\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u6bd4\u8f83\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u9762\uff1a\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a(i)\u4ece\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5185\u90e8\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c(ii)\u4ece\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ecf\u9a8c\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c(iii)\u4ece\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ed3\u679c\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u6237\u6216\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\uff0c(iv)\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b-\u6210\u672c\u914d\u7f6e\u5e76\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528PRISM Alignment\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u548c\u4f7f\u7528HealthBench\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u9884\u6d4b\u90e8\u7f72\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u611f\u77e5\u6392\u884c\u699c\u4e0e\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6392\u540d\u6709\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "ML Compass\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86AI\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b-\u90e8\u7f72\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5728\u8003\u8651\u7528\u6237\u6548\u7528\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u5355\u7eaf\u80fd\u529b\u6392\u540d\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u8350\u3002"}}

This memory constraint precludes genomic-scale modeling (L > 10^5) on consumer-grade hardware. We introduce Phase Gradient Flow (PGF), a framework that computes exact analytical derivatives by operating directly in the state-space manifold, bypassing the need to materialize the intermediate computational graph. By reframing SSM dynamics as Tiled Operator-Space Evolution (TOSE), our method delivers O(1) memory complexity relative to sequence length, yielding a 94% reduction in peak VRAM and a 23x increase in throughput compared to standard Autograd. Unlike parallel prefix scans that exhibit numerical divergence in stiff ODE regimes, PGF ensures stability through invariant error scaling, maintaining near-machine precision across extreme sequences. We demonstrate the utility of PGF on an impulse-response benchmark with 128,000-step sequences - a scale where conventional Autograd encounters prohibitive memory overhead, often leading to out-of-memory (OOM) failures in multi-layered models. Our work enables chromosome-scale sensitivity analysis on a single GPU, bridging the gap between theoretical infinite-context models and practical hardware limitations.", "AI": {"tldr": "PGF\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u6790\u5bfc\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u7684O(1)\u5185\u5b58\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SSM\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b(SSMs)\u867d\u7136\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u671f\u95f4\u53d7\u5230O(L)\u5185\u5b58\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u89c4\u6a21\u5efa\u6a21(L > 10^5)\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u76f8\u4f4d\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41(PGF)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u64cd\u4f5c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u6790\u5bfc\u6570\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u56fe\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06SSM\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u5e73\u94fa\u7b97\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6f14\u5316(TOSE)\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u7684O(1)\u5185\u5b58\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6Autograd\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cPGF\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8694%\u7684\u5cf0\u503cVRAM\u51cf\u5c11\u548c23\u500d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5728128,000\u6b65\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u54cd\u5e94\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPGF\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edfAutograd\u4f1a\u9047\u5230\u5185\u5b58\u6ea2\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u673a\u5668\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "PGF\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u5355\u4e2aGPU\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u67d3\u8272\u4f53\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u65e0\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

In particular, a Bayesian optimization (BO) driven Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) method is proposed, which determines the device served order sequence and the corresponding modulation and coding scheme (MCS) adaptively based on the imperfect CSI. Note that the imperfection of CSI, error sample imbalance in URLLC networks, as well as the parameter sensitivity nature of the TD3 algorithm likely diminish the algorithm's convergence speed and reliability. To address such an issue, we proposed a BO based training mechanism for the convergence speed improvement, which provides a more reliable learning direction and sample selection method to track the imbalance sample problem.

However, their deployment with federated learning (FL) faces two critical challenges: 1) resource-constrained edge devices cannot store full expert sets, and 2) non-IID data distributions cause severe expert load imbalance that degrades model performance. To this end, we propose \\textbf{FLEX-MoE}, a novel federated MoE framework that jointly optimizes expert assignment and load balancing under limited client capacity. Specifically, our approach introduces client-expert fitness scores that quantify the expert suitability for local datasets through training feedback, and employs an optimization-based algorithm to maximize client-expert specialization while enforcing balanced expert utilization system-wide. Unlike existing greedy methods that focus solely on personalization while ignoring load imbalance, our FLEX-MoE is capable of addressing the expert utilization skew, which is particularly severe in FL settings with heterogeneous data.

We present VL-RouterBench to assess the overall capability of VLM routing systems systematically. The benchmark is grounded in raw inference and scoring logs from VLMs and constructs quality and cost matrices over sample-model pairs. In scale, VL-RouterBench covers 14 datasets across 3 task groups, totaling 30,540 samples, and includes 15 open-source models and 2 API models, yielding 519,180 sample-model pairs and a total input-output token volume of 34,494,977. The evaluation protocol jointly measures average accuracy, average cost, and throughput, and builds a ranking score from the harmonic mean of normalized cost and accuracy to enable comparison across router configurations and cost budgets. On this benchmark, we evaluate 10 routing methods and baselines and observe a significant routability gain, while the best current routers still show a clear gap to the ideal Oracle, indicating considerable room for improvement in router architecture through finer visual cues and modeling of textual structure.

However, most approaches rely on explicit weight updates, overlooking the extensive representational structures already encoded in pre-trained models that remain underutilized. Recent works have demonstrated that Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT) can be a powerful and efficient post-training paradigm for language models. Instead of updating weights, MFT assigns learnable gating scores to each weight, allowing the model to reorganize its internal subnetworks for downstream task adaptation. In this paper, we rethink fine-tuning for VLMs from a structural reparameterization perspective grounded in MFT. We apply MFT to the language and projector components of VLMs with different language backbones and compare against strong PEFT baselines. Experiments show that MFT consistently surpasses LoRA variants and even full fine-tuning, achieving high performance without altering the frozen backbone. Our findings reveal that effective adaptation can emerge not only from updating weights but also from reestablishing connections among the model's existing knowledge.

The dominant paradigm--Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)--enforces feature invariance, aligning source and target representations via symmetric divergence minimization [Ganin et al., 2016]. We demonstrate that this approach is fundamentally flawed: when domains are unequally informative (e.g., high-quality vs degraded sensors), strict invariance necessitates information destruction, causing \"negative transfer\" that can be catastrophic in safety-critical applications [Wang et al., 2019].\n  We propose a decision-theoretic framework grounded in Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments [Le Cam, 1986], using constructive approximations to replace symmetric invariance with directional simulability. We introduce Le Cam Distortion, quantified by the Deficiency Distance $\u03b4(E_1, E_2)$, as a rigorous upper bound for transfer risk conditional on simulability. Our framework enables transfer without source degradation by learning a kernel that simulates the target from the source. Across five experiments (genomics, vision, reinforcement learning), Le Cam Distortion achieves: (1) near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics (correlation $r=0.999$, matching classical methods), (2) zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 image classification (81.2% accuracy preserved vs 34.7% drop for CycleGAN), and (3) safe policy transfer in RL control where invariance-based methods suffer catastrophic collapse.

Existing systems often rely on a single agent to handle the entire workflow-interpreting issues, navigating large codebases, and implementing fixes-within one reasoning chain. Such monolithic designs force the model to retain irrelevant context, leading to spurious correlations and poor generalization. Motivated by how human engineers decompose complex problems, we propose structuring SWE agents as orchestrators coordinating specialized sub-agents for sub-tasks such as localization, editing, and validation. The challenge lies in discovering effective hierarchies automatically: as the number of sub-agents grows, the search space becomes combinatorial, and it is difficult to attribute credit to individual sub-agents within a team. We address these challenges by formulating hierarchy discovery as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, where each arm represents a candidate sub-agent and the reward measures its helpfulness when collaborating with others. This framework, termed Bandit Optimization for Agent Design (BOAD), enables efficient exploration of sub-agent designs under limited evaluation budgets. On SWE-bench-Verified, BOAD outperforms single-agent and manually designed multi-agent systems. On SWE-bench-Live, featuring more recent and out-of-distribution issues, our 36B system ranks second on the leaderboard at the time of evaluation, surpassing larger models such as GPT-4 and Claude. These results demonstrate that automatically discovered hierarchical multi-agent systems significantly improve generalization on challenging long-horizon SWE tasks.

In distributed systems, interdependent data sources reveal hidden relationships and latent structures, representing valuable information for many applications. This paper introduces Osmotic Learning (OSM-L), a self-supervised distributed learning paradigm designed to uncover higher-level latent knowledge from distributed data. The core of OSM-L is osmosis, a process that synthesizes dense and compact representation by extracting contextual information, eliminating the need for raw data exchange between distributed entities. OSM-L iteratively aligns local data representations, enabling information diffusion and convergence into a dynamic equilibrium that captures contextual patterns. During training, it also identifies correlated data groups, functioning as a decentralized clustering mechanism. Experimental results confirm OSM-L's convergence and representation capabilities on structured datasets, achieving over 0.99 accuracy in local information alignment while preserving contextual integrity.", "AI": {"tldr": "OSM-L\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e17\u900f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ece\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u9636\u6f5c\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u672c\u5730\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6269\u6563\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u9690\u85cf\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u8bb8\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6e17\u900f\u5b66\u4e60\uff08OSM-L\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u6e17\u900f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u5408\u6210\u5bc6\u96c6\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b9e\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\u8fed\u4ee3\u5bf9\u9f50\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fe1\u606f\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6536\u655b\u5230\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8fd8\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u805a\u7c7b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eOSM-L\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u672c\u5730\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u9f50\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc70.99\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "OSM-L\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u9636\u6f5c\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u53d1\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, these feature values are typically obtained through long simulation cycles and expensive computations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a multi-layer Perceptron architecture, termed squeeze and excitation multi-layer perceptron (SE-MLP), which integrates a channel attention mechanism with residual connections to enable rapid prediction of acceleration feature values. Using physical parameters under different working conditions as inputs, the model outputs layer-wise acceleration features, thereby establishing a nonlinear mapping between physical parameters and penetration characteristics. Comparative experiments against conventional MLP, XGBoost, and Transformer models demonstrate that SE-MLP achieves superior prediction accuracy, generalization, and stability. Ablation studies further confirm that both the channel attention module and residual structure contribute significantly to performance gains. Numerical simulations and range recovery tests show that the discrepancies between predicted and measured acceleration peaks and pulse widths remain within acceptable engineering tolerances.

However, optimizing these metrics present significant computational and statistical challenges. Existing approaches often rely on the characterization of the Bayes-optimal classifier, and use threshold-based methods that first estimate class probabilities and then seek an optimal threshold. This leads to algorithms that are not tailored to restricted hypothesis sets and lack finite-sample performance guarantees. In this work, we introduce principled algorithms for optimizing generalized metrics, supported by $H$-consistency and finite-sample generalization bounds.

While machine learning and deep learning techniques have been applied successfully to cross-sectional classification and prediction tasks, effectively forecasting outcomes in longitudinal imaging studies remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a time-aware graph neural network model with transformer fusion (GNN-TF). This model flexibly integrates both tabular data and dynamic brain connectivity data, leveraging the temporal order of these variables within a coherent framework. By incorporating non-Euclidean and Euclidean sources of information from a longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), the GNN-TF enables a comprehensive analysis that captures critical aspects of longitudinal imaging data. Comparative analyses against a variety of established machine learning and deep learning models demonstrate that GNN-TF outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior predictive accuracy for predicting future tobacco usage. The end-to-end, time-aware transformer fusion structure of the proposed GNN-TF model successfully integrates multiple data modalities and leverages temporal dynamics, making it a valuable analytic tool for functional brain imaging studies focused on clinical outcome prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "GNN-TF\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8111\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548cTransformer\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u70df\u8349\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6574\u5408\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8111\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u52a8\u6001\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u6570\u636e\uff09\u4e0e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff08\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u662f\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u7ed3\u679c\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7eb5\u5411\u6210\u50cf\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0eTransformer\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff08GNN-TF\uff09\uff0c\u7075\u6d3b\u6574\u5408\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8eNCANDA\u7eb5\u5411\u9759\u606f\u6001fMRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u7eb5\u5411\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u5df2\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0cGNN-TF\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u70df\u8349\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GNN-TF\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5Transformer\u878d\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u6210\u529f\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u6001\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ed3\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u8111\u6210\u50cf\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Even in tasks with abundant strong signals, the key to improving model performance often lies in effectively extracting weak signals. However, the lack of dedicated datasets has long constrained research. To address this, we construct the first specialized dataset for weak signal feature learning, containing 13,158 spectral samples. It features low SNR dominance (over 55% samples with SNR below 50) and extreme class imbalance (class ratio up to 29:1), providing a challenging benchmark for classification and regression in weak signal scenarios. We also propose a dual-view representation (vector + time-frequency map) and a PDVFN model tailored to low SNR, distribution skew, and dual imbalance. PDVFN extracts local sequential features and global frequency-domain structures in parallel, following principles of local enhancement, sequential modeling, noise suppression, multi-scale capture, frequency extraction, and global perception. This multi-source complementarity enhances representation for low-SNR and imbalanced data, offering a novel solution for WSL tasks like astronomical spectroscopy. Experiments show our method achieves higher accuracy and robustness in handling weak signals, high noise, and extreme class imbalance, especially in low SNR and imbalanced scenarios.

This work develops a decentralized projected gradient descent-based algorithm for multi-task representation learning. We focus on the problem of multi-task linear regression in which multiple linear regression models share a common, low-dimensional linear representation. We present an alternating projected gradient descent and minimization algorithm for recovering a low-rank feature matrix in a diffusion-based decentralized and federated fashion.

RLVR incentivizes language models to enhance their reasoning capabilities through verifiable feedback; however, while methods like LoRA are commonly used, the optimal PEFT architecture for RLVR remains unidentified. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of over 12 PEFT methodologies across the DeepSeek-R1-Distill families on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our empirical results challenge the default adoption of standard LoRA with three main findings. First, we demonstrate that structural variants, such as DoRA, AdaLoRA, and MiSS, consistently outperform LoRA. Second, we uncover a spectral collapse phenomenon in SVD-informed initialization strategies (\\textit{e.g.,} PiSSA, MiLoRA), attributing their failure to a fundamental misalignment between principal-component updates and RL optimization. Furthermore, our ablations reveal that extreme parameter reduction (\\textit{e.g.,} VeRA, Rank-1) severely bottlenecks reasoning capacity.

While accurate prediction of their physicochemical properties is essential for accelerating peptide development, existing molecular language models rely on representations that fail to capture this complexity. Atom-level SMILES notation generates long token sequences and obscures cyclic topology, whereas amino-acid-level representations cannot encode the diverse chemical modifications central to modern peptide design. To bridge this representational gap, the Hierarchical Editing Language for Macromolecules (HELM) offers a unified framework enabling precise description of both monomer composition and connectivity, making it a promising foundation for peptide language modeling. Here, we propose HELM-BERT, the first encoder-based peptide language model trained on HELM notation. Based on DeBERTa, HELM-BERT is specifically designed to capture hierarchical dependencies within HELM sequences. The model is pre-trained on a curated corpus of 39,079 chemically diverse peptides spanning linear and cyclic structures. HELM-BERT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SMILES-based language models in downstream tasks, including cyclic peptide membrane permeability prediction and peptide-protein interaction prediction.

The standard algorithm, Online Newton Step (ONS), balances statistical optimality and computational practicality, guaranteeing an optimal regret of $O(d \\log T)$, where $d$ is the dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. ONS faces a computational bottleneck due to the Mahalanobis projections at each round. This step costs $\u03a9(d^\u03c9)$ arithmetic operations for bounded domains, even for the unit ball, where $\u03c9\\in (2,3]$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent. As a result, the total runtime can reach $\\tilde{O}(d^\u03c9T)$, particularly when iterates frequently oscillate near the domain boundary. For Stochastic eXp-concave Optimization (SXO), computational cost is also a challenge. Deploying ONS with online-to-batch conversion for SXO requires $T = \\tilde{O}(d/\u03b5)$ rounds to achieve an excess risk of $\u03b5$, and thereby necessitates an $\\tilde{O}(d^{\u03c9+1}/\u03b5)$ runtime. A COLT'13 open problem posed by Koren [2013] asks for an SXO algorithm with runtime less than $\\tilde{O}(d^{\u03c9+1}/\u03b5)$.\n  This paper proposes a simple variant of ONS, LightONS, which reduces the total runtime to $O(d^2 T + d^\u03c9\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ while preserving the optimal $O(d \\log T)$ regret. LightONS implies an SXO method with runtime $\\tilde{O}(d^3/\u03b5)$, thereby answering the open problem. Importantly, LightONS preserves the elegant structure of ONS by leveraging domain-conversion techniques from parameter-free online learning to introduce a hysteresis mechanism that delays expensive Mahalanobis projections until necessary. This design enables LightONS to serve as an efficient plug-in replacement of ONS in broader scenarios, even beyond regret minimization, including gradient-norm adaptive regret, parametric stochastic bandits, and memory-efficient online learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "LightONS\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u6307\u6570\u51f9\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u603b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4eceO(d^\u03c9T)\u964d\u4f4e\u5230O(d\u00b2T + d^\u03c9\u221aTlogT)\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u7684O(d log T)\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u56de\u7b54\u4e86COLT'13\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6307\u6570\u51f9\u4f18\u5316(OXO)\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u7b97\u6cd5ONS\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5176Mahalanobis\u6295\u5f71\u6b65\u9aa4\u6bcf\u6b21\u9700\u8981\u03a9(d^\u03c9)\u6b21\u7b97\u672f\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u603b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u8fbe\u5230O(d^\u03c9T)\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6307\u6570\u51f9\u4f18\u5316(SXO)\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ONS\u9700\u8981O(d^{\u03c9+1}/\u03b5)\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7fKoren\u5728COLT'13\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bfb\u627e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c0f\u4e8eO(d^{\u03c9+1}/\u03b5)\u7684SXO\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LightONS\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u662fONS\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u53d8\u4f53\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u65e0\u5173\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u57df\u8f6c\u6362\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6ede\u540e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6602\u8d35\u7684Mahalanobis\u6295\u5f71\u76f4\u5230\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u624d\u6267\u884c\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86ONS\u7684\u4f18\u96c5\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "LightONS\u5c06\u603b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u964d\u4f4e\u5230O(d\u00b2T + d^\u03c9\u221aTlogT)\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u7684O(d log T)\u9057\u61be\u754c\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8eSXO\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86O(d\u00b3/\u03b5)\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u56de\u7b54\u4e86COLT'13\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd8\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3aONS\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "LightONS\u7b97\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u6307\u6570\u51f9\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6ede\u540e\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7edf\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

By keeping data local and coordinating model training through a central server, FL effectively addresses privacy concerns and reduces communication overhead. However, the limited computational power, memory, and bandwidth of IoT edge devices pose significant challenges to the efficiency and scalability of FL, especially when training deep neural networks. Various FL frameworks have been proposed to reduce computation and communication overheads through dropout or layer freezing. However, these approaches often sacrifice accuracy or neglect memory constraints. To this end, in this work, we introduce Federated Learning with Ordered Layer Freezing (FedOLF). FedOLF consistently freezes layers in a predefined order before training, significantly mitigating computation and memory requirements. To further reduce communication and energy costs, we incorporate Tensor Operation Approximation (TOA), a lightweight alternative to conventional quantization that better preserves model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that over non-iid data, FedOLF achieves at least 0.3%, 6.4%, 5.81%, 4.4%, 6.27% and 1.29% higher accuracy than existing works respectively on EMNIST (with CNN), CIFAR-10 (with AlexNet), CIFAR-100 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), and CINIC-10 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), along with higher energy efficiency and lower memory footprint.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedOLF\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u987a\u5e8f\u51bb\u7ed3\u5c42\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5f20\u91cf\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6280\u672f\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982dropout\u6216\u5c42\u51bb\u7ed3\u5f80\u5f80\u727a\u7272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6216\u5ffd\u7565\u5185\u5b58\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFedOLF\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u6309\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u987a\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u51bb\u7ed3\u5c42\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u5f20\u91cf\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u91cf\u5316\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0cFedOLF\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aEMNIST(CNN)\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad80.3%\uff0cCIFAR-10(AlexNet)\u9ad86.4%\uff0cCIFAR-100(ResNet20/44)\u9ad85.81%/4.4%\uff0cCINIC-10(ResNet20/44)\u9ad86.27%/1.29%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "FedOLF\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u5e8f\u5c42\u51bb\u7ed3\u548c\u5f20\u91cf\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

However, graph data often exhibits overlap among different clients. Previous research has demonstrated certain benefits of overlapping data in mitigating data heterogeneity. However, the negative effects have not been explored, particularly in cases where the overlaps are imbalanced across clients. In this paper, we uncover the unfairness issue arising from imbalanced overlapping subgraphs through both empirical observations and theoretical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose FairGFL (FAIRness-aware subGraph Federated Learning), a novel algorithm that enhances cross-client fairness while maintaining model utility in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, FairGFL incorporates an interpretable weighted aggregation approach to enhance fairness across clients, leveraging privacy-preserving estimation of their overlapping ratios. Furthermore, FairGFL improves the tradeoff between model utility and fairness by integrating a carefully crafted regularizer into the federated composite loss function. Through extensive experiments on four benchmark graph datasets, we demonstrate that FairGFL outperforms four representative baseline algorithms in terms of both model utility and fairness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFairGFL\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u91cd\u53e0\u5b50\u56fe\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5b50\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u91cd\u53e0\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u597d\u5904\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u91cd\u53e0\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFairGFL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u590d\u5408\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFairGFL\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u56db\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FairGFL\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56fe\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u56e0\u91cd\u53e0\u5b50\u56fe\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Generally, such problems are solved by optimizing reporting odds ratio (ROR) or proportional reporting ratio (PRR).

In this paper, we propose PFed-signal, a federated learning-based signal prediction model of ADR, which utilizes the Euclidean distance to eliminate the biased data from FAERS, thereby improving the accuracy of ADR prediction. Specifically, we first propose Pfed-Split, a method to split the original dataset into a split dataset based on ADR. Then we propose ADR-signal, an ADR prediction model, including a biased data identification method based on federated learning and an ADR prediction model based on Transformer. The former identifies the biased data according to the Euclidean distance and generates a clean dataset by deleting the biased data. The latter is an ADR prediction model based on Transformer trained on the clean data set. The results show that the ROR and PRR on the clean dataset are better than those of the traditional methods.

Why bother doing manual backpropagation when there are so many tools that do this automatically? Any gap in understanding of how values propagate forward will become evident when attempting to differentiate the loss function.

In comparison, existing proximal policy methods such as GRPO or CISPO use multiple gradient steps with variants of importance ratio clipping to approximate a natural gradient step relative to a reference policy.

However, conventional velocity model building methods are often computationally expensive and time consuming. In recent years, with the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly the success of generative models and neural operators, deep learning based approaches that integrate data and their statistics have attracted increasing attention in addressing the limitations of traditional methods. In this study, we propose a novel framework that combines generative models with neural operators to obtain high resolution velocity models efficiently. Within this workflow, the neural operator functions as a forward mapping operator to rapidly generate time lag reverse time migration (RTM) extended images from the true and migration velocity models. In this framework, the neural operator is acting as a surrogate for modeling followed by migration, which uses the true and migration velocities, respectively. The trained neural operator is then employed, through automatic differentiation, to gradually update the migration velocity placed in the true velocity input channel with high resolution components so that the output of the network matches the time lag images of observed data obtained using the migration velocity. By embedding a generative model, trained on a high-resolution velocity model distribution, which corresponds to the true velocity model distribution used to train the neural operator, as a regularizer, the resulting predictions are cleaner with higher resolution information. Both synthetic and field data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generative neural operator based velocity model building approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u901f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u524d\u5411\u6620\u5c04\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210RTM\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u901f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u522b\u662f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u524d\u5411\u6620\u5c04\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u504f\u79fb\u901f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u6ede\u540eRTM\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u9010\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u504f\u79fb\u901f\u5ea6\uff1b3) \u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u901f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u751f\u6210\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u901f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5e72\u51c0\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this context, methods developed for the non-blind case cannot be adapted in a straightforward manner. Recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed to address blind inverse problems, demonstrating strong empirical performance and adaptability. However, these methods often lack interpretability and are not supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, limiting their reliability in applied domains such as imaging inverse problems. In this work, we shed light on learning in blind inverse problems within the simplified yet insightful framework of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs). We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form expressions for optimal estimators and extending classical results. In particular, we establish equivalences with suitably chosen Tikhonov-regularized formulations, where the regularization depends explicitly on the distributions of the unknown signal, the noise, and the random forward operators. We also prove convergence results under appropriate source condition assumptions. Furthermore, we derive rigorous finite-sample error bounds that characterize the performance of learned estimators as a function of the noise level, problem conditioning, and number of available samples. These bounds explicitly quantify the impact of operator randomness and reveal the associated convergence rates as this randomness vanishes. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through illustrative numerical experiments that confirm the predicted convergence behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u76f2\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e0eTikhonov\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f2\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u524d\u5411\u7b97\u5b50\u90e8\u5206\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u672a\u77e5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6210\u50cf\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff08LMMSE\uff09\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u4f18\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e0eTikhonov\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u660e\u786e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u672a\u77e5\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u968f\u673a\u524d\u5411\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u6e90\u6761\u4ef6\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u754c\u9650\u660e\u786e\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u7b97\u5b50\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u968f\u673a\u6027\u6d88\u5931\u65f6\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f2\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

FgGSL employs a learnable, symmetric, feature-driven masking function to infer said complementary graphs, which are processed using pre-designed low- and high-pass graph filter banks. A label-based structural loss explicitly promotes the recovery of homophilic and heterophilic edges, enabling task-driven graph structure learning.

However, recent state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches like Masked Autoencoding (MAE), despite their strong representation learning capabilities, lack temporal awareness. In this paper, we propose STAMP (Stochastic Temporal Autoencoder with Masked Pretraining), a Siamese MAE framework that encodes temporal information through a stochastic process by conditioning on the time difference between the 2 input volumes. Unlike deterministic Siamese approaches, which compare scans from different time points but fail to account for the inherent uncertainty in disease evolution, STAMP learns temporal dynamics stochastically by reframing the MAE reconstruction loss as a conditional variational inference objective. We evaluated STAMP on two OCT and one MRI datasets with multiple visits per patient.

Unlike standard Mixture-of-LoRAs, which incurs O(M rd) parameter complexity by retrieving independent rank-r matrices, DSC constructs a compositional rank-K approximation from decoupled unit-norm basis vectors.

From ResNet for visual recognition to Transformer for vision-language alignment, the AI models have achieved superior capability to humans. Furthermore, the scaling law has enabled AI to initially develop general intelligence, as demonstrated by Large Language Models (LLMs). To this stage, AI has had an enormous influence on society and yet still keeps shaping the future for humanity. However, distribution shift remains a persistent ``Achilles' heel'', fundamentally limiting the reliability and general usefulness of ML systems. Moreover, generalization under distribution shift would also cause trust issues for AIs. Motivated by these challenges, my research focuses on \\textit{Trustworthy Machine Learning under Distribution Shifts}, with the goal of expanding AI's robustness, versatility, as well as its responsibility and reliability. We carefully study the three common distribution shifts into: (1) Perturbation Shift, (2) Domain Shift, and (3) Modality Shift. For all scenarios, we also rigorously investigate trustworthiness via three aspects: (1) Robustness, (2) Explainability, and (3) Adaptability.

Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a reliable source for emotion recognition due to its high temporal resolution and its direct reflection of neural activity. Nevertheless, variations across recording sessions present a major challenge for model generalization. To address this issue, we propose EGDA, a framework that reduces cross-session discrepancies by jointly aligning the global (marginal) and class-specific (conditional) distributions, while preserving the intrinsic structure of EEG data through graph regularization. Experimental results on the SEED-IV dataset demonstrate that EGDA achieves robust cross-session performance, obtaining accuracies of 81.22%, 80.15%, and 83.27% across three transfer tasks, and surpassing several baseline methods. Furthermore, the analysis highlights the Gamma frequency band as the most discriminative and identifies the central-parietal and prefrontal brain regions as critical for reliable emotion recognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "EGDA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5bf9\u9f50\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8de8\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u5347EEG\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u4eba\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u72b6\u6001\u5bf9\u6709\u6548\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46EEG\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bb0\u5f55\u4f1a\u8bdd\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u7ed9\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEGDA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5bf9\u9f50\u5168\u5c40\uff08\u8fb9\u9645\uff09\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\uff08\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u8de8\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4fdd\u6301EEG\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784", "result": "\u5728SEED-IV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cEGDA\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u8fc1\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u83b7\u5f9781.22%\u300180.15%\u548c83.27%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "EGDA\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u4f1a\u8bddEEG\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0cGamma\u9891\u6bb5\u6700\u5177\u533a\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u4e2d\u592e-\u9876\u53f6\u548c\u524d\u989d\u53f6\u8111\u533a\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981"}}

Turner"], "title": "Random Controlled Differential Equations", "comment": null, "summary": "We introduce a training-efficient framework for time-series learning that combines random features with controlled differential equations (CDEs). In this approach, large randomly parameterized CDEs act as continuous-time reservoirs, mapping input paths to rich representations. Only a linear readout layer is trained, resulting in fast, scalable models with strong inductive bias. Building on this foundation, we propose two variants: (i) Random Fourier CDEs (RF-CDEs): these lift the input signal using random Fourier features prior to the dynamics, providing a kernel-free approximation of RBF-enhanced sequence models; (ii) Random Rough DEs (R-RDEs): these operate directly on rough-path inputs via a log-ODE discretization, using log-signatures to capture higher-order temporal interactions while remaining stable and efficient. We prove that in the infinite-width limit, these model induces the RBF-lifted signature kernel and the rough signature kernel, respectively, offering a unified perspective on random-feature reservoirs, continuous-time deep architectures, and path-signature theory.\n  We evaluate both models across a range of time-series benchmarks, demonstrating competitive or state-of-the-art performance. These methods provide a practical alternative to explicit signature computations, retaining their inductive bias while benefiting from the efficiency of random features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u6548\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u968f\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u5316CDE\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u50a8\u5c42\uff0c\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ebf\u6027\u8bfb\u51fa\u5c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u968f\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u50a8\u5c42\uff0c\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ebf\u6027\u8bfb\u51fa\u5c42\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u53d8\u4f53\uff1a1) \u968f\u673a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6CDE\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u5347\u8f93\u5165\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b2) \u968f\u673a\u7c97\u7cd9DE\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7log-ODE\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u7c97\u7cd9\u8def\u5f84\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528log-signature\u6355\u83b7\u9ad8\u9636\u65f6\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u522b\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51faRBF\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u7b7e\u540d\u6838\u548c\u7c97\u7cd9\u7b7e\u540d\u6838\u3002\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6216\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u7b7e\u540d\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u7b7e\u540d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture -- a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7 times faster than full attention for 128K context.

A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. A frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, with the rubrics creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct a study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours. The experts prefer plans generated by our finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, and approve 84% of the automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. To assess generality, we also extend our approach to research goals from medical papers, and new arXiv preprints, evaluating with a jury of frontier models. Our finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, proving effective even in problem settings like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, automated training recipe as a step towards improving general AI co-scientists.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u6587\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u597d\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u6240\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u9690\u542b\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u800cAI\u5171\u540c\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u9700\u8981\u5177\u5907\u6839\u636e\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u751f\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u534f\u52a9\u4eba\u7c7b\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5b9e\u73b0\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "1. \u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff1b2. \u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u5206\u8bad\u7ec3\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u521d\u59cb\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u51bb\u7ed3\u526f\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u521b\u5efa\u751f\u6210\u5668-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u5916\u90e8\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "1. \u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff08225\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u572870%\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u66f4\u504f\u597d\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684Qwen3-30B-A3B\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\uff1b2. 84%\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5b9a\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u83b7\u5f97\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba4\u53ef\uff1b3. \u6269\u5c55\u5230\u533b\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u548carXiv\u9884\u5370\u672c\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u5ba1\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u5e26\u676512-22%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u901a\u7528AI\u5171\u540c\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7b49\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4e5f\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u8f85\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
