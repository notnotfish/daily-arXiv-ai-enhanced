Within this broader landscape, Entity Set Expansion is one prominent task aimed at taking an initial set of (tuples of) entities and identifying additional ones that share relevant semantic properties with the former -- potentially repeating the process to form increasingly broader sets. However, this ``linear'' approach does not unveil the richer ``taxonomic'' structures present in knowledge resources. A recent logic-based framework introduces the notion of an expansion graph: a rooted directed acyclic graph where each node represents a semantic generalization labeled by a logical formula, and edges encode strict semantic inclusion. This structure supports taxonomic expansions of entity sets driven by knowledge bases. Yet, the potentially large size of such graphs may make full materialization impractical in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we formalize reasoning tasks that check whether two tuples belong to comparable, incomparable, or the same nodes in the graph. Our results show that, under realistic assumptions -- such as bounding the input or limiting entity descriptions -- these tasks can be implemented efficiently. This enables local, incremental navigation of expansion graphs, supporting practical applications without requiring full graph construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u907f\u514d\u5b8c\u5168\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u578b\u56fe\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u589e\u91cf\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8d44\u6e90\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u5b8c\u5168\u6784\u5efa\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u7531\u903b\u8f91\u516c\u5f0f\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u8fb9\u7f16\u7801\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5305\u542b\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u68c0\u67e5\u4e24\u4e2a\u5143\u7ec4\u5728\u56fe\u4e2d\u8282\u70b9\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9650\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u5b9e\u4f53\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u9650\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u5b9e\u4f53\u63cf\u8ff0\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u589e\u91cf\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u5168\u6784\u5efa\u6574\u4e2a\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u6784\u5efa\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6269\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, their scalability is limited by the quadratic cost of maintaining dense item-item similarity matrices. Partitioning-based paradigms have recently emerged as an effective strategy for balancing effectiveness and efficiency, enabling models to learn local similarities within coherent subgraphs while maintaining a limited global context. In this work, we focus on the Fine-tuning Partition-aware Similarity Refinement (FPSR) framework, a prominent representative of this family, as well as its extension, FPSR+. Reproducible evaluation of partition-aware collaborative filtering remains challenging, as prior FPSR/FPSR+ reports often rely on splits of unclear provenance and omit some similarity-based baselines, thereby complicating fair comparison. We present a transparent, fully reproducible benchmark of FPSR and FPSR+. Based on our results, the family of FPSR models does not consistently perform at the highest level. Overall, it remains competitive, validates its design choices, and shows significant advantages in long-tail scenarios. This highlights the accuracy-coverage trade-offs resulting from partitioning, global components, and hub design.

SGI-Bench comprises over 1,000 expert-curated, cross-disciplinary samples inspired by Science's 125 Big Questions, enabling systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal gaps: low exact match (10--20%) in deep research despite step-level alignment; ideas lacking feasibility and detail; high code executability but low execution result accuracy in dry experiments; low sequence fidelity in wet protocols; and persistent multimodal comparative-reasoning challenges. We further introduce Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which optimizes retrieval-augmented novelty rewards at inference, enhancing hypothesis novelty without reference answer. Together, our PIM-grounded definition, workflow-centric benchmark, and empirical insights establish a foundation for AI systems that genuinely participate in scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd(SGI)\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u8df5\u63a2\u7a76\u6a21\u578b(PIM)\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b1000\u591a\u4e2a\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u6837\u672c\u7684SGI-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u5404\u73af\u8282\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(TTRL)\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5047\u8bbe\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u79d1\u5b66AI\u6709\u6240\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd(SGI)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5373\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u6784\u601d\u3001\u8c03\u67e5\u548c\u8de8\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u7684SGI\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u8df5\u63a2\u7a76\u6a21\u578b(PIM\uff1a\u5ba1\u8bae\u3001\u6784\u601d\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u611f\u77e5)\u5efa\u7acbSGI\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u60f3\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5e72/\u6e7f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u521b\u5efaSGI-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b1000\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u7075\u611f\u6765\u81ea\u300a\u79d1\u5b66\u300b\u6742\u5fd7\u7684125\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(TTRL)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1a\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u7387\u4f4e(10-20%)\uff1b\u60f3\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b\u5e72\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6027\u9ad8\u4f46\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u679c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4f4e\uff1b\u6e7f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\u5e8f\u5217\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4f4e\uff1b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6bd4\u8f83\u63a8\u7406\u6311\u6218\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u3002TTRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u53c2\u8003\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u589e\u5f3a\u5047\u8bbe\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8ePIM\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u4ee5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u89c1\u89e3\u4e3a\u771f\u6b63\u53c2\u4e0e\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

The recent release of Grokipedia, a fully AI-generated encyclopedia, introduces a new alternative to traditional, well-established platforms like Wikipedia. In this context, search engine mechanisms play an important role in guiding users exploratory paths, yet their behavior across different encyclopedic systems remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by providing the first comparative analysis of search engine in Wikipedia and Grokipedia.\n  Using nearly 10,000 neutral English words and their substrings as queries, we collect over 70,000 search engine results and examine their semantic alignment, overlap, and topical structure. We find that both platforms frequently generate results that are weakly related to the original query and, in many cases, surface unexpected content starting from innocuous queries. Despite these shared properties, the two systems often produce substantially different recommendation sets for the same query. Through topical annotation and trajectory analysis, we further identify systematic differences in how content categories are surfaced and how search engine results evolve over multiple stages of exploration.\n  Overall, our findings show that unexpected search engine outcomes are a common feature of both the platforms, even though they exhibit discrepancies in terms of topical distribution and query suggestions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u548cGrokipedia\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u7ecf\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u67e5\u8be2\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u751a\u81f3\u4ece\u65e0\u5bb3\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u5448\u73b0\u610f\u5916\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u76f8\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u767e\u79d1\u5168\u4e66Grokipedia\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u767e\u79d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u548cGrokipedia\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd110,000\u4e2a\u4e2d\u6027\u82f1\u8bed\u5355\u8bcd\u53ca\u5176\u5b50\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u4f5c\u4e3a\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u8d85\u8fc770,000\u4e2a\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u91cd\u53e0\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3b\u9898\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e73\u53f0\u90fd\u7ecf\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u67e5\u8be2\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u4ece\u65e0\u5bb3\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u5448\u73b0\u610f\u5916\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6709\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5171\u540c\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u76f8\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u5efa\u8bae\u65b9\u9762\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u610f\u5916\u641c\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u548cGrokipedia\u4e2d\u90fd\u662f\u5e38\u89c1\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u5efa\u8bae\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u767e\u79d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u884c\u4e3a\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u533a\u522b\u3002"}}

These workflows generate rapidly expanding contexts that must be curated, transformed, and compressed to maintain fidelity, avoid attention dilution, and reduce inference cost. Prior work on summarization and query-aware compression largely ignores the multi-step, plan-aware nature of agentic reasoning. In this work, we introduce PAACE (Plan-Aware Automated Context Engineering), a unified framework for optimizing the evolving state of LLM agents through next-k-task relevance modeling, plan-structure analysis, instruction co-refinement, and function-preserving compression. PAACE comprises (1) PAACE-Syn, a large-scale generator of synthetic agent workflows annotated with stepwise compression supervision, and (2) PAACE-FT, a family of distilled, plan-aware compressors trained from successful teacher demonstrations. Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks (AppWorld, OfficeBench, and 8-Objective QA) demonstrate that PAACE consistently improves agent correctness while substantially reducing context load. On AppWorld, PAACE achieves higher accuracy than all baselines while lowering peak context and cumulative dependency.

However, such separate application may lead to semantic misalignment between the expanded queries (or documents) and their relevant documents (or queries). To address this serious issue, we propose TCDE, a dual expansion strategy that leverages large language models (LLMs) for topic-centric enrichment on both queries and documents. In TCDE, we design two distinct prompt templates for processing each query and document. On the query side, an LLM is guided to identify distinct sub-topics within each query and generate a focused pseudo-document for each sub-topic. On the document side, an LLM is guided to distill each document into a set of core topic sentences. The resulting outputs are used to expand the original query and document. This topic-centric dual expansion process establishes semantic bridges between queries and their relevant documents, enabling better alignment for downstream retrieval models. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, TREC Deep Learning and BEIR, demonstrate that TCDE achieves substantial improvements over strong state-of-the-art expansion baselines. In particular, on dense retrieval tasks, it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, with a relative improvement of 2.8\\% in NDCG@10 on the SciFact dataset.

This paper investigates security threats in AgVs, including OWASP-style risks and cyber-attacks from other layers affecting the agentic layer. By introducing a role-based architecture for agentic vehicles, consisting of a Personal Agent and a Driving Strategy Agent, we will investigate vulnerabilities in both agentic AI layer and cross-layer risks, including risks originating from upstream layers (e.g., perception layer, control layer, etc.).

In this paper, we study the problem of improving RecSys model predictions for cold-start (CS) items, which appear infrequently in the training data. Although this problem is well-studied in academia, few studies have addressed its root causes effectively at the scale of a platform like Pinterest. By investigating live traffic data, we identified several challenges of the CS problem and developed a corresponding solution for each: First, industrial-scale RecSys models must operate under tight computational constraints. Since CS items are a minority, any related improvements must be highly cost-efficient. To address this, our solutions were designed to be lightweight, collectively increasing the total parameters by only 5%. Second, CS items are represented only by non-historical (e.g., content or attribute) features, which models often treat as less important. To elevate their significance, we introduce a residual connection for the non-historical features. Third, CS items tend to receive lower prediction scores compared to non-CS items, reducing their likelihood of being surfaced.

However, real-world queries are often relational, seeking to understand how entities are associated. In this work, we introduce relation-centric KGQA, a complementary setting where the answer is a subgraph capturing the semantic connections among entities rather than an individual entity. The main challenge lies in the abundance of candidate subgraphs, where trivial or overly common connections often obscure the identification of unique and informative answers. To tackle this, we propose UniRel-R1, a unified framework that integrates subgraph selection, multi-stage graph pruning, and an LLM fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. The reward function is designed to encourage compact and specific subgraphs with more informative relations and lower-degree intermediate entities. Extensive experiments show that UniRel-R1 achieves significant gains in connectivity and reward over Vanilla baselines and generalizes effectively to unseen entities and relations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u56fe\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86UniRel-R1\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5019\u9009\u5b50\u56fe\u8fc7\u591a\u548c\u7410\u788e\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u8fd4\u56de\u5355\u4e2a\u7b54\u6848\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u67e5\u8be2\u5f80\u5f80\u662f\u5173\u7cfb\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u5b9e\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniRel-R1\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5b50\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u56fe\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9f13\u52b1\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u4f4e\u5ea6\u4e2d\u95f4\u5b9e\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUniRel-R1\u5728\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u65b9\u9762\u76f8\u6bd4Vanilla\u57fa\u7ebf\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u662f\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8865\u5145\uff0cUniRel-R1\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5019\u9009\u5b50\u56fe\u8fc7\u591a\u548c\u7410\u788e\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5b9e\u4f53\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

A key challenge lies in the large semantic gap between LLMs and RecSys where the former internalizes language world knowledge while the latter captures personalized world of behaviors. Unfortunately, the research community lacks a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the LLMs over their limitations and boundaries in RecSys so that we can draw a confident conclusion. To investigate this, we propose a benchmark named LRWorld containing over 38K high-quality samples and 23M tokens carefully compiled and generated from widely used public recommendation datasets. LRWorld categorizes the mental world of LLMs in RecSys as three main scales (association, personalization, and knowledgeability) spanned by ten factors with 31 measures (tasks). Based on LRWorld, comprehensive experiments on dozens of LLMs show that they are still not well capturing the deep neural personalized embeddings but can achieve good results on shallow memory-based item-item similarity. They are also good at perceiving item entity relations, entity hierarchical taxonomies, and item-item association rules when inferring user interests.

This project presents a low-cost, dual-mode neuro-muscular control system integrating electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to enable real-time, multi-degree-of-freedom control of a prosthetic arm. EEG signals are acquired using the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2 and transmitted via ThinkGear Bluetooth packets to an ESP32 microcontroller running a lightweight classification model. The model was trained on 1500 seconds of recorded EEG data using a 6-frame sliding window with low-pass filtering, excluding poor-signal samples and using a 70/20/10 training--validation--test split. The classifier detects strong blink events, which toggle the hand between open and closed states. EMG signals are acquired using a MyoWare 2.0 sensor and SparkFun wireless shield and transmitted to a second ESP32, which performs threshold-based detection. Three activation bands (rest: 0--T1; extension: T1--T2; contraction: greater than T2) enable intuitive elbow control, with movement triggered only after eight consecutive frames in a movement class to improve stability. The EEG-controlled ESP32 actuates four finger servos, while the EMG-controlled ESP32 drives two elbow servos. A functional prototype was constructed using low-cost materials (total cost approximately 240 dollars), with most expense attributed to the commercial EEG headset. Future work includes transitioning to a 3D-printed chassis, integrating auto-regressive models to reduce EMG latency, and upgrading servo torque for improved load capacity and grip strength. This system demonstrates a feasible pathway to low-cost, biologically intuitive prosthetic control suitable for underserved and global health applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u808c\u8089\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408EEG\u548cEMG\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b9e\u73b0\u5047\u80a2\u624b\u81c2\u7684\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u603b\u6210\u672c\u7ea6240\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u80a2\u5047\u80a2\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u89c2\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u622a\u80a2\u8005\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2\u91c7\u96c6EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ThinkGear\u84dd\u7259\u4f20\u8f93\u5230ESP32\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7728\u773c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\u624b\u90e8\u5f00\u5408\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528MyoWare 2.0\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u91c7\u96c6EMG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8098\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u91c7\u75288\u5e27\u8fde\u7eed\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u539f\u578b\uff0cEEG\u63a7\u5236\u56db\u4e2a\u624b\u6307\u8235\u673a\uff0cEMG\u63a7\u5236\u4e24\u4e2a\u8098\u90e8\u8235\u673a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u603b\u6210\u672c\u7ea6240\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6210\u672c\u6765\u81ea\u5546\u7528EEG\u5934\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u751f\u7269\u76f4\u89c9\u5047\u80a2\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u548c\u5168\u7403\u5065\u5eb7\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u6539\u8fdb\u5305\u62ec3D\u6253\u5370\u5916\u58f3\u3001\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u8235\u673a\u626d\u77e9\u3002"}}

Progress is limited by weak causal control, ethical constraints, and scarce temporal data. We address these barriers using simulations of large language model (LLM)-driven agents in virtual societies, independently varying realistic and symbolic threat while tracking actions, language, and attitudes. Representational analyses show that the underlying LLM encodes realistic threat, symbolic threat, and hostility as distinct internal states, that our manipulations map onto them, and that steering these states causally shifts behavior. Our simulations provide a causal account of threat-driven conflict over time: realistic threat directly increases hostility, whereas symbolic threat effects are weaker, fully mediated by ingroup bias, and increase hostility only when realistic threat is absent. Non-hostile intergroup contact buffers escalation, and structural asymmetries concentrate hostility among majority groups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u865a\u62df\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7269\u8d28\u5a01\u80c1\u548c\u8c61\u5f81\u6027\u5a01\u80c1\u5982\u4f55\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u4e3b\u5bfc\u51b2\u7a81\u884c\u4e3a", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b2\u7a81\u5e38\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u7269\u8d28\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u8c61\u5f81\u6027\u4ef7\u503c\u53d7\u5230\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ee5\u53ca\u54ea\u4e2a\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u53d7\u5230\u56e0\u679c\u63a7\u5236\u5f31\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u9650\u5236", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u865a\u62df\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u53d8\u5316\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u548c\u8c61\u5f81\u6027\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6001\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76LLM\u5982\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u8fd9\u4e9b\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u64cd\u7eb5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u72b6\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a", "result": "\u5e95\u5c42LLM\u5c06\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u3001\u8c61\u5f81\u6027\u5a01\u80c1\u548c\u654c\u610f\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u76f4\u63a5\u589e\u52a0\u654c\u610f\uff0c\u800c\u8c61\u5f81\u6027\u5a01\u80c1\u6548\u5e94\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u4e2d\u4ecb\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u654c\u610f\uff1b\u975e\u654c\u610f\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u63a5\u89e6\u80fd\u7f13\u51b2\u51b2\u7a81\u5347\u7ea7\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u4f7f\u654c\u610f\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u591a\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5a01\u80c1\u9a71\u52a8\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u91ca\uff1a\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u662f\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u8c61\u5f81\u6027\u5a01\u80c1\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u95f4\u63a5\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u53ea\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u63a5\u89e6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u8d77\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528"}}

To overcome this, BSARec augments the Transformer encoder with a frequency layer that rescales high-frequency components using the Fourier transform. However, the overall effectiveness of BSARec and the roles of its individual components have yet to be systematically validated. We reproduce BSARec and show that it outperforms other SR methods on some datasets. To empirically assess whether BSARec improves performance on high-frequency signals, we propose a metric to quantify user history frequency and evaluate SR methods across different user groups. We compare digital signal processing (DSP) techniques and find that the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) offer only slight improvements over Fourier transforms, and DSP methods provide no clear advantage over simple residual connections. Finally, we explore padding strategies and find that non-constant padding significantly improves recommendation performance, whereas constant padding hinders the frequency rescaler's ability to capture high-frequency signals.", "AI": {"tldr": "BSARec\u901a\u8fc7\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u589e\u5f3aTransformer\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u6355\u83b7\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0DSP\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u7b80\u5355\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u4f18\u52bf\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u975e\u6052\u5b9a\u586b\u5145\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u66f4\u5173\u952e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6355\u6349\u53cd\u6620\u77ed\u671f\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "BSARec\u5728Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u9891\u7387\u5c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u91cd\u65b0\u7f29\u653e\u9ad8\u9891\u5206\u91cf\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5316\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u9891\u7387\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u7ec4\u4e0a\u7684SR\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "BSARec\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6SR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u79bb\u6563\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u76f8\u6bd4\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u4ec5\u6709\u8f7b\u5fae\u6539\u8fdb\uff1bDSP\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u7b80\u5355\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u975e\u6052\u5b9a\u586b\u5145\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136BSARec\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u589e\u5f3a\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86Transformer\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u6355\u83b7\uff0c\u4f46DSP\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4f18\u52bf\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u586b\u5145\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

Among the prominent approaches, the Kernel Trick, widely used in support vector machines, provides efficient similarity computation, while the Pretty Good Measurement (PGM), originating from quantum state discrimination, enables classification grounded in Hilbert space geometry. Building on recent developments in kernelized PGM (KPGM) and direct PGM-based classifiers, this work presents a unified theoretical and empirical comparison of these paradigms. We analyze their performance across synthetic oversampling scenarios using Quantum SMOTE (QSMOTE) variants. Experimental results show that both PGM and KPGM classifiers consistently outperform a classical random forest baseline, particularly when multiple quantum copies are employed. Notably, PGM with stereo encoding and n_copies=2 achieves the highest overall accuracy (0.8512) and F1-score (0.8234), while KPGM demonstrates competitive and more stable behavior across QSMOTE variants, with top scores of 0.8511 (stereo) and 0.8483 (amplitude). These findings highlight that quantum-inspired classifiers not only provide tangible gains in recall and balanced performance but also offer complementary strengths: PGM benefits from encoding-specific enhancements, whereas KPGM ensures robustness across sampling strategies.

Assigning a utility to each possible interaction history forces us to confront the ambiguity that some hypotheses in the agent's belief distribution only predict a finite prefix of the history, which is sometimes interpreted as implying a chance of death equal to a quantity called the semimeasure loss. This death interpretation suggests one way to assign utilities to such history prefixes. We argue that it is as natural to view the belief distributions as imprecise probability distributions, with the semimeasure loss as total ignorance. This motivates us to consider the consequences of computing expected utilities with Choquet integrals from imprecise probability theory, including an investigation of their computability level. We recover the standard recursive value function as a special case.

Through a two month-long randomised controlled trial, we compare an agentic messaging approach against a business-as-usual (BAU) rule-based campaign system, focusing on two primary outcomes: unsubscribe behaviour and conversion timing. Empirical results show that agent-led messaging reduced unsubscribe events by 21\\% ($\\pm 0.01$) relative to BAU and increased early filing behaviour in the weeks preceding the national deadline.

Experimental results demonstrate that this compressor possesses extreme domain discriminative capability: it achieves a reconstruction accuracy of \\textbf{99.47\\%} on the in-domain (code) validation set; accuracy drops sharply to \\textbf{47.76\\%} on a semi-out-of-distribution domain (Wiki text); and further plummets to just \\textbf{0.57\\%} on a fully out-of-distribution domain (random sequences).\n  This extreme and systematic performance discrepancy establishes the validity of reconstruction error as an \\textbf{Intrinsic Distribution Fingerprint}. Based on this, we propose that expert modules can be automatically scheduled using reconstruction residuals directly, without the need for explicit gating networks. This mechanism offers excellent scalability. Furthermore, this architecture provides a new perspective on ``VRAM compression'' for handling ultra-long contexts. This report aims to verify the physical validity of this foundational architecture, offering a new research perspective for the next generation of scalable modular neural networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\"\u538b\u7f29\u5373\u8def\u7531\"\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u7406\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Transformer\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b9e\u73b064\u500d\u5e8f\u5217\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u6307\u7eb9\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u3001\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e14\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6df7\u5408\u57df\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\"\u538b\u7f29\u5373\u667a\u80fd\"\u7684\u524d\u63d0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\"\u538b\u7f29\u5373\u8def\u7531\"\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u7406\u5ff5\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a8700\u4e07\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aefTransformer\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0512\u4e2atoken\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a8\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u5411\u91cf\u768464\u500d\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u3002\u5229\u7528\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u6307\u7eb9\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\u53ef\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u91cd\u5efa\u6b8b\u5dee\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u95e8\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6781\u7aef\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u5728\u57df\u5185\uff08\u4ee3\u7801\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523099.47%\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u534a\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u57df\uff08Wiki\u6587\u672c\uff09\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9aa4\u964d\u81f347.76%\uff1b\u5728\u5168\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u57df\uff08\u968f\u673a\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u66b4\u8dcc\u81f30.57%\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6781\u7aef\u4e14\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u6307\u7eb9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u8d85\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\"VRAM\u538b\u7f29\"\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u95e8\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\u3002"}}

While general-purpose programming languages are well supported, generating code for domain-specific languages remains a challenging problem for LLMs. In this paper, we focus on the LLM-based generation of code for Answer Set Programming (ASP), a particularly effective approach for finding solutions to combinatorial search problems. The effectiveness of LLMs in ASP code generation is currently hindered by the limited number of examples seen during their initial pre-training phase.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for solver-guided instruction-tuning of LLMs to addressing the highly complex semantic parsing task inherent in ASP code generation. Our method only requires problem specifications in natural language and their solutions. Specifically, we sample ASP statements for program continuations from LLMs for unriddling logic puzzles. Leveraging the special property of declarative ASP programming that partial encodings increasingly narrow down the solution space, we categorize them into chosen and rejected instances based on solver feedback. We then apply supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs on the curated data and further improve robustness using a solver-guided search that includes best-of-N sampling.

However, common methods largely rely on co-occurrence, making them prone to item popularity bias and user attributes, which degrades embedding quality and performance. Meanwhile, although diversity is acknowledged as a key aspect of recommendation quality, existing research offers limited attention to it, with a notable lack of causal perspectives and theoretical grounding. To address these challenges, we propose Cadence: Diversity Recommendation via Causal Deconfounding of Co-purchase Relations and Counterfactual Exposure - a plug-and-play framework built upon LightGCN as the backbone, primarily designed to enhance recommendation diversity while preserving accuracy. First, we compute the Unbiased Asymmetric Co-purchase Relationship (UACR) between items - excluding item popularity and user attributes - to construct a deconfounded directed item graph, with an aggregation mechanism to refine embeddings.

Current operational approaches rely on computationally intensive numerical weather prediction guidance and human-issued TAF products, which often exhibit conservative biases and limited temporal resolution. This study presents a lightweight gradient boosting framework (XGBoost) trained exclusively on surface observation data (METAR) and enhanced through physics-guided feature engineering based on thermodynamic principles. The framework is evaluated across 11 international airports representing distinct climatic regimes (including SCEL, KJFK, KORD, KDEN, SBGR, and VIDP) using historical data from 2000 to 2024. Results suggest that the model successfully captures underlying local physical processes without manual configuration. In a blind comparative evaluation against operational TAF forecasts, the automated model achieved substantially higher detection rates at tactical horizons (3 hours), with a 2.5 to 4.0 times improvement in recall while reducing false alarms. Furthermore, SHAP analysis reveals that the model performs an implicit reconstruction of local physical drivers (advection, radiation, and subsidence), providing actionable explainability for operational situational awareness.\n  Keywords: aviation meteorology; physics-guided machine learning; explainable artificial intelligence; lightweight machine learning; nowcasting; METAR; TAF verification; edge computing", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eXGBoost\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5730\u9762\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff08METAR\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u573a\u4f4e\u80fd\u89c1\u5ea6\u548c\u964d\u6c34\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\uff08\u4e34\u8fd1\u9884\u62a5\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e1a\u52a1\u9884\u62a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u53d1\u5e03\u7684TAF\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4fdd\u5b88\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u4fdd\u969c\u822a\u7a7a\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528XGBoost\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528METAR\u5730\u9762\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u572811\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u4e0d\u540c\u6c14\u5019\u533a\u7684\u56fd\u9645\u673a\u573a\uff08\u5305\u62ecSCEL\u3001KJFK\u3001KORD\u3001KDEN\u3001SBGR\u3001VIDP\uff09\u4f7f\u75282000-2024\u5e74\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76f2\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6218\u672f\u9884\u62a5\u65f6\u6b21\uff083\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e1a\u52a1TAF\u9884\u62a5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e862.5\u52304.0\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bef\u62a5\u3002SHAP\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u9690\u5f0f\u91cd\u5efa\u5c40\u5730\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u5b50\uff08\u5e73\u6d41\u3001\u8f90\u5c04\u3001\u4e0b\u6c89\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e1a\u52a1\u6001\u52bf\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u5730\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u822a\u7a7a\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4e1a\u52a1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

One promising approach is implementing skill libraries that allow agents to learn, validate, and apply new skills. However, current skill library approaches rely primarily on LLM prompting, making consistent skill library implementation challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to enhance agents' self-improvement capabilities with a skill library. Specifically, we introduce Skill Augmented GRPO for self-Evolution (SAGE), a novel RL framework that systematically incorporates skills into learning. The framework's key component, Sequential Rollout, iteratively deploys agents across a chain of similar tasks for each rollout. As agents navigate through the task chain, skills generated from previous tasks accumulate in the library and become available for subsequent tasks. Additionally, the framework enhances skill generation and utilization through a Skill-integrated Reward that complements the original outcome-based rewards.

However, directly applying the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to multi-turn tasks exposes notable limitations, particularly in scenarios requiring long-horizon reasoning. To address these challenges, we investigate more stable and effective advantage estimation strategies, especially for multi-turn settings. We first explore Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as an alternative and find it to be more robust than GRPO. To further enhance PPO in multi-turn scenarios, we introduce turn-PPO, a variant that operates on a turn-level MDP formulation, as opposed to the commonly used token-level MDP. Our results on the WebShop and Sokoban datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of turn-PPO, both with and without long reasoning components.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u8f6e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86turn-PPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6c\u5411\u8f6e\u7ea7MDP\u516c\u5f0f\u6765\u589e\u5f3aPPO\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GRPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9700\u8981\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u63a2\u7d22PPO\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6bd4GRPO\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3002\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51faturn-PPO\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f6e\u7ea7MDP\u516c\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7MDP\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aPPO\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728WebShop\u548cSokoban\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cturn-PPO\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u5305\u542b\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u7ec4\u4ef6\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "turn-PPO\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6c\u5411\u8f6e\u7ea7MDP\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u8f6e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing approaches struggle to balance accuracy and simplicity when evaluating multiple candidate solutions. We propose a Solomonoff-inspired method that weights LLM-generated hypotheses by simplicity and predictive fit. Applied to benchmark (Mini-ARC) tasks, our method produces Solomonoff-weighted mixtures for per-cell predictions, yielding conservative, uncertainty-aware outputs even when hypotheses are noisy or partially incorrect. Compared to Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Solomonoff scoring spreads probability more evenly across competing hypotheses, while BMA concentrates weight on the most likely but potentially flawed candidates.

To address this gap, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning into multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation, enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models through a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework to achieve explainable multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation.

In this work, we study distribution restoration with abundant noisy samples, assuming the corruption process is available as a black-box generator. We show that this task can be framed as a one-sided entropic optimal transport problem and solved via an EM-like algorithm. We further provide a test criterion to determine whether the true underlying distribution is recoverable under per-sample information loss, and show that in otherwise unrecoverable cases, a small number of clean samples can render the distribution largely recoverable. Building on these insights, we introduce SFBD-OMNI, a bridge model-based framework that maps corrupted sample distributions to the ground-truth distribution. Our method generalizes Stochastic Forward-Backward Deconvolution (SFBD; Lu et al., 2025) to handle arbitrary measurement models beyond Gaussian corruption.

First, UmniBench can assess the understanding, generation, and editing ability within a single evaluation process. Based on human-examined prompts and QA pairs, UmniBench leverages UMM itself to evaluate its generation and editing ability with its understanding ability. This simple but effective paradigm allows comprehensive evaluation of UMMs. Second, UmniBench covers 13 major domains and more than 200 concepts, ensuring a thorough inspection of UMMs. Moreover, UmniBench can also decouple and separately evaluate understanding, generation, and editing abilities, providing a fine-grained assessment.

On-device agents typically use a retrieval module to select relevant tools, improving performance and reducing context length. However, existing retrieval methods rely on static and limited inputs, failing to capture multi-step tool dependencies and evolving task context. This limitation often introduces irrelevant tools that mislead the agent, degrading efficiency and accuracy. We propose Dynamic Tool Dependency Retrieval (DTDR), a lightweight retrieval method that conditions on both the initial query and the evolving execution context. DTDR models tool dependencies from function calling demonstrations, enabling adaptive retrieval as plans unfold.

Even modest per-step planning delays can destabilize control and degrade overall performance. We propose a speculation-and-correction framework that adapts the predict-then-verify philosophy of speculative execution to model-based control with TD-MPC2. At each step, a pretrained world model and latent-space MPC planner generate a short-horizon action queue together with predicted latent rollouts, allowing the agent to execute multiple planned actions without immediate replanning. When a new observation arrives, the system measures the mismatch between the encoded real latent state and the queued predicted latent. For small to moderate mismatch, a lightweight learned corrector applies a residual update to the speculative action, distilled offline from a replanning teacher. For large mismatch, the agent safely falls back to full replanning and clears stale action queues. We study both a gated two-tower MLP corrector and a temporal Transformer corrector to address local errors and systematic drift. Experiments on the DMC Humanoid-Walk task show that our method reduces the number of planning inferences from 500 to 282, improves end-to-end step latency by 25 percent, and maintains strong control performance with only a 7.1 percent return reduction. Ablation results demonstrate that speculative execution without correction is unreliable over longer horizons, highlighting the necessity of mismatch-aware correction for robust latency reduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u63a8\u6d4b-\u6821\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u6d4b\u6267\u884c\u601d\u60f3\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u52a8\u4f5c\u961f\u5217\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6821\u6b63\u5668\u51cf\u5c11\u89c4\u5212\u63a8\u7406\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u987a\u5e8f\u63a7\u5236\u4ee3\u7406\u5e38\u53d7\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u6bcf\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e5f\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u63a7\u5236\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u51cf\u5c11\u89c4\u5212\u63a8\u7406\u6b21\u6570\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u63a8\u6d4b-\u6821\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408TD-MPC2\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\uff1a1) \u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4MPC\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u751f\u6210\u77ed\u65f6\u57df\u52a8\u4f5c\u961f\u5217\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b2) \u65b0\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u8fbe\u65f6\u6d4b\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1b3) \u5c0f\u5230\u4e2d\u7b49\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u6821\u6b63\u5668\u5bf9\u63a8\u6d4b\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e94\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b4) \u5927\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u56de\u9000\u5230\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\u5e76\u6e05\u9664\u8fc7\u65f6\u52a8\u4f5c\u961f\u5217\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u95e8\u63a7\u53cc\u5854MLP\u6821\u6b63\u5668\u548c\u65f6\u5e8fTransformer\u6821\u6b63\u5668", "result": "\u5728DMC Humanoid-Walk\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff1a\u89c4\u5212\u63a8\u7406\u6b21\u6570\u4ece500\u51cf\u5c11\u5230282\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6b65\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6539\u558425%\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u4ec5\u964d\u4f4e7.1%\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u65e0\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u6267\u884c\u5728\u8f83\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u6d4b-\u6821\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u4f5c\u961f\u5217\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6821\u6b63\u5668\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6821\u6b63\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51cf\u5c11\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684"}}

To appear in Hudl Performance Insights 2025", "summary": "Transfers play a pivotal role in shaping a football club's success, yet forecasting whether a transfer will succeed remains difficult due to the strong context-dependence of on-field performance. Existing evaluation practices often rely on static summary statistics or post-hoc value models, which fail to capture how a player's contribution adapts to a new tactical environment or different teammates. To address this gap, we introduce EventGPT, a player-conditioned, value-aware next-event prediction model built on a GPT-style autoregressive transformer. Our model treats match play as a sequence of discrete tokens, jointly learning to predict the next on-ball action's type, location, timing, and its estimated residual On-Ball Value (rOBV) based on the preceding context and player identity. A key contribution of this framework is the ability to perform counterfactual simulations. By substituting learned player embeddings into new event sequences, we can simulate how a player's behavioral distribution and value profile would change when placed in a different team or tactical structure. Evaluated on five seasons of Premier League event data, EventGPT outperforms existing sequence-based baselines in next-event prediction accuracy and spatial precision. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's practical utility for transfer analysis through case studies-such as comparing striker performance across different systems and identifying stylistic replacements for specific roles-showing that our approach provides a principled method for evaluating transfer fit.", "AI": {"tldr": "EventGPT\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eGPT\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7403\u5458\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4ef7\u503c\u611f\u77e5\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8db3\u7403\u8f6c\u4f1a\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\u8bc4\u4f30\u7403\u5458\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6218\u672f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f6c\u4f1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u6216\u4e8b\u540e\u4ef7\u503c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7403\u5458\u5728\u65b0\u6218\u672f\u73af\u5883\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\u961f\u53cb\u914d\u5408\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316\u7403\u5458\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u8f6c\u4f1a\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1EventGPT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eGPT\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52transformer\uff0c\u5c06\u6bd4\u8d5b\u5904\u7406\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563token\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u6301\u7403\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u53ca\u5176\u6b8b\u5dee\u6301\u7403\u4ef7\u503c(rOBV)\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7403\u5458\u5d4c\u5165\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7403\u5458\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7403\u961f\u6216\u6218\u672f\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u8d5b\u5b63\u7684\u82f1\u8d85\u8054\u8d5b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cEventGPT\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f6c\u4f1a\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e0b\u524d\u950b\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u66ff\u4ee3\u8005\u3002", "conclusion": "EventGPT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u4f1a\u9002\u914d\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u7403\u5458\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6218\u672f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6c\u4f1a\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Pok\u00e9mon battles demand reasoning about type matchups, statistical trade-offs, and risk assessment, skills that mirror human strategic thinking. This work examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as competent battle agents, capable of both making tactically sound decisions and generating novel, balanced game content. We developed a turn-based Pok\u00e9mon battle system where LLMs select moves based on battle state rather than pre-programmed logic. The framework captures essential Pok\u00e9mon mechanics: type effectiveness multipliers, stat-based damage calculations, and multi-Pok\u00e9mon team management. Through systematic evaluation across multiple model architectures we measured win rates, decision latency, type-alignment accuracy, and token efficiency. These results suggest LLMs can function as dynamic game opponents without domain-specific training, offering a practical alternative to reinforcement learning for turn-based strategic games.

We investigate whether training on intentionally flawed reasoning traces can teach models to detect and recover from such errors without degrading standard problem-solving ability. Using competition-level problems from MATH-lighteval, we generate CoT prefixes containing exactly one controlled error, either a calculation error (sign flips, dropped terms) or a reasoning error (misapplied rules, unjustified logical steps), and fine-tune Qwen3-4B with GRPO using a binary final-answer reward. Our Mixed-CoT-RL model matches standard RL on clean problems (41% vs 41%) while substantially outperforming it on problems prefilled with flawed reasoning (24% vs 19%). Notably, clean-only RL fine-tuning degrades robustness below the untuned baseline 19% vs. 20%), indicating that conventional training increases susceptibility to misleading prefills. Among error types, training on reasoning errors yields greater robustness gains than calculation errors alone, with mixed training performing best.

One challenge is that human concepts themselves are fluid: conceptual boundaries can shift, split, and merge as inquiry progresses (e.g., Pluto is no longer considered a planet). To make progress, we need a definition of \"concept\" that is not merely a dictionary label, but a structure that can be revised, compared, and aligned across agents. We propose an algorithmic-information viewpoint that treats a concept as an information object defined only through its structural relation to an agent's total experience. The core constraint is determination: a set of parts forms a reversible consistency relation if any missing part is recoverable from the others (up to the standard logarithmic slack in Kolmogorov-style identities). This reversibility prevents \"concepts\" from floating free of experience and turns concept existence into a checkable structural claim. To judge whether a decomposition is natural, we define excess information, measuring the redundancy overhead introduced by splitting experience into multiple separately described parts. On top of these definitions, we formulate dialectics as an optimization dynamics: as new patches of information appear (or become contested), competing concepts bid to explain them via shorter conditional descriptions, driving systematic expansion, contraction, splitting, and merging. Finally, we formalize low-cost concept transmission and multi-agent alignment using small grounds/seeds that allow another agent to reconstruct the same concept under a shared protocol, making communication a concrete compute-bits trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6574\u4f53\u7ecf\u9a8c\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9006\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\u672c\u8eab\u5177\u6709\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\uff08\u5982\u51a5\u738b\u661f\u4e0d\u518d\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u884c\u661f\uff09\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bcd\u5178\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u4e49\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u88ab\u4fee\u8ba2\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6574\u4f53\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u7ea6\u675f\u662f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1a\u4e00\u7ec4\u90e8\u5206\u5f62\u6210\u53ef\u9006\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5373\u4efb\u4f55\u7f3a\u5931\u90e8\u5206\u90fd\u80fd\u4ece\u5176\u4ed6\u90e8\u5206\u6062\u590d\uff08\u5728Kolmogorov\u5f0f\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u677e\u5f1b\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u8fa9\u8bc1\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8ba9\u7ade\u4e89\u6982\u5ff5\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u77ed\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6536\u7f29\u3001\u5206\u88c2\u548c\u5408\u5e76\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6982\u5ff5\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\u7684\u79cd\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\u6982\u5ff5\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u901a\u4fe1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97-\u6bd4\u7279\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u53d1\u73b0\u6982\u5ff5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4e3b\u5f20\u800c\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, the squaring operation introduces additional complexity when computing the partition function or marginalizing variables, which hinders their applicability in ML. To solve this issue, canonical forms of TNs are parameterized via unitary matrices to simplify the computation of marginals. However, these canonical forms do not apply to circuits, as they can represent factorizations that do not directly map to a known TN. Inspired by the ideas of orthogonality in canonical forms and determinism in circuits enabling tractable maximization, we show how to parameterize squared circuits to overcome their marginalization overhead. Our parameterizations unlock efficient marginalization even in factorizations different from TNs, but encoded as circuits, whose structure would otherwise make marginalization computationally hard. Finally, our experiments on distribution estimation show how our proposed conditions in squared circuits come with no expressiveness loss, while enabling more efficient learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5e73\u65b9\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u53ca\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5f62\u5f0f\u5e73\u65b9\u7535\u8def\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5177\u6709\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u95ed\u5f0f\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u5e73\u65b9\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u914d\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u6216\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e73\u65b9\u7535\u8def\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u662f\uff1a\u5e73\u65b9\u64cd\u4f5c\u867d\u7136\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u914d\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u6216\u8fdb\u884c\u53d8\u91cf\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u8303\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u601d\u60f3\u548c\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5e73\u65b9\u7535\u8def\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5e73\u65b9\u7535\u8def\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f46\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7535\u8def\u7684\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u7535\u8def\u6761\u4ef6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u9501\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u539f\u672c\u4f1a\u4f7f\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u7535\u8def\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5e73\u65b9\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5e73\u65b9\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5e73\u65b9\u7535\u8def\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

This effect has been studied extensively in classification tasks, but not in sequential decision-making, where an agent learns a policy to achieve an objective by taking actions in an environment. In this paper, we translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making. We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. We further show that ensembles constructed from the Rashomon set exhibit greater robustness to distribution shifts than individual policies. Additionally, permissive policies derived from the Rashomon set reduce computational requirements for verification while maintaining optimal performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\u4ece\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u53ca\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u5177\u6709\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6bd4\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u66f4\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u79cd\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u5c06Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\u5b9a\u4e49\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\uff1a\u591a\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u76f8\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u8bbf\u95ee\u76f8\u540c\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u540c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6982\u7387\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u6b21\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eRashomon\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u4eceRashomon\u96c6\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u5355\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u4eceRashomon\u96c6\u5408\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u5bbd\u677e\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u786e\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff1aRashomon\u96c6\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5bbd\u677e\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

These problems often lead to delays in treatment and poor health outcomes. Most current AI and deep learning diagnostic systems are not very interactive or transparent, making them less effective in real-world, patient-centered environments. This research introduces a diagnostic chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), using GPT-4o, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and explainable AI techniques. The chatbot engages patients in a dynamic conversation, helping to extract and normalize symptoms while prioritizing potential diagnoses through similarity matching and adaptive questioning. With Chain-of-Thought prompting, the system also offers more transparent reasoning behind its diagnoses. When tested against traditional machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN, the LLM-based system delivered impressive results, achieving an accuracy of 90% and Top-3 accuracy of 100%.

However, their black-box nature limits trust and adoption, especially in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. To address this challenge, we introduce UniCoMTE, a model-agnostic framework for generating counterfactual explanations for multivariate time series classifiers. The framework identifies temporal features that most heavily influence a model's prediction by modifying the input sample and assessing its impact on the model's prediction. UniCoMTE is compatible with a wide range of model architectures and operates directly on raw time series inputs. In this study, we evaluate UniCoMTE's explanations on a time series ECG classifier. We quantify explanation quality by comparing our explanations' comprehensibility to comprehensibility of established techniques (LIME and SHAP) and assessing their generalizability to similar samples. Furthermore, clinical utility is assessed through a questionnaire completed by medical experts who review counterfactual explanations presented alongside original ECG samples. Results show that our approach produces concise, stable, and human-aligned explanations that outperform existing methods in both clarity and applicability.

To express non-Markovian rewards, formalisms such as reward machines have been introduced to capture dependencies on histories. However, traditional reward machines lack the ability to model precise timing constraints, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. In this paper, we propose timed reward machines (TRMs), which are an extension of reward machines that incorporate timing constraints into the reward structure. TRMs enable more expressive specifications with tunable reward logic, for example, imposing costs for delays and granting rewards for timely actions. We study model-free RL frameworks (i.e., tabular Q-learning) for learning optimal policies with TRMs under digital and real-time semantics. Our algorithms integrate the TRM into learning via abstractions of timed automata, and employ counterfactual-imagining heuristics that exploit the structure of the TRM to improve the search. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm learns policies that achieve high rewards while satisfying the timing constraints specified by the TRM on popular RL benchmarks.

However, existing fault quantification methods often suffer from limited efficiency and interpretability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel fault quantification approach for PV strings based on a differentiable fast fault simulation model (DFFSM). The proposed DFFSM accurately models I-V characteristics under multiple faults and provides analytical gradients with respect to fault parameters. Leveraging this property, a gradient-based fault parameters identification (GFPI) method using the Adahessian optimizer is developed to efficiently quantify partial shading, short-circuit, and series-resistance degradation. Experimental results on both simulated and measured I-V curves demonstrate that the proposed GFPI achieves high quantification accuracy across different faults, with the I-V reconstruction error below 3%, confirming the feasibility and effectiveness of the application of differentiable physical simulators for PV system fault diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u5feb\u901f\u6545\u969c\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u578b(DFFSM)\u7684\u5149\u4f0f\u4e32\u6545\u969c\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6545\u969c\u53c2\u6570\u8bc6\u522b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5149\u4f0f\u9635\u5217\u6545\u969c\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u6280\u672f\u6765\u652f\u6301\u5149\u4f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8fd0\u884c\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u7ef4\u62a4", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u5feb\u901f\u6545\u969c\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u578b(DFFSM)\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u6545\u969c\u4e0b\u7684I-V\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6545\u969c\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u68af\u5ea6\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4f7f\u7528Adahessian\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6545\u969c\u53c2\u6570\u8bc6\u522b(GFPI)\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u6d4bI-V\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cGFPI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6545\u969c\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u90e8\u5206\u9634\u5f71\u3001\u77ed\u8def\u3001\u4e32\u8054\u7535\u963b\u9000\u5316\uff09\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u91cf\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0cI-V\u91cd\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e3%", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5728\u5149\u4f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5149\u4f0f\u9635\u5217\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8fd0\u884c\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u7ef4\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

This shift has triggered urgent debate regarding Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics to synthetic agents, and its potential to induce misplaced trust or emotional dependency. However, the causal link between more humanlike AI design and subsequent effects on engagement and trust has not been tested in realistic human-AI interactions with a global user pool. Prevailing safety frameworks continue to rely on theoretical assumptions derived from Western populations, overlooking the global diversity of AI users. Here, we address these gaps through two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations, involving real-time and open-ended interactions with an AI system. We find that when evaluating an AI's human-likeness, users focus less on the kind of theoretical aspects often cited in policy (e.g., sentience or consciousness), but rather applied, interactional cues like conversation flow or understanding the user's perspective. We also experimentally demonstrate that humanlike design levers can causally increase anthropomorphism among users; however, we do not find that humanlike design universally increases behavioral measures for user engagement and trust, as previous theoretical work suggests. Instead, part of the connection between human-likeness and behavioral outcomes is fractured by culture: specific design choices that foster self-reported trust in AI-systems in some populations (e.g., Brazil) may trigger the opposite result in others (e.g., Japan). Our findings challenge prevailing narratives of inherent risk in humanlike AI design. Instead, we identify a nuanced, culturally mediated landscape of human-AI interaction, which demands that we move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach in AI governance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cAI\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u975e\u666e\u904d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u53d7\u5230\u6587\u5316\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u663e\u8457\u8c03\u8282\u3002\u7528\u6237\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ebf\u7d22\u800c\u975e\u7406\u8bba\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u76f8\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u53cd\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u76ca\u62df\u4eba\u5316\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5f53\u4fe1\u4efb\u6216\u60c5\u611f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u897f\u65b9\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u7528\u6237\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u8003\u8651\uff0c\u4e14\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u5c1a\u672a\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8de8\u56fd\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08N=3,500\uff09\uff0c\u6db5\u76d610\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u56fd\u5bb6\uff0c\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u4e0eAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6027\u5730\u6d4b\u8bd5\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6760\u6746\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u91cf\u5176\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "1. \u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u65f6\uff0c\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u5982\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6d41\u7545\u5ea6\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u7528\u6237\u89c6\u89d2\uff09\u800c\u975e\u7406\u8bba\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u611f\u77e5\u6216\u610f\u8bc6\uff09\u30022. \u62df\u4eba\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u5730\u589e\u52a0\u7528\u6237\u7684\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u30023. \u4f46\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u672a\u666e\u904d\u589e\u52a0\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6307\u6807\u30024. \u62df\u4eba\u5316\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u53d7\u5230\u6587\u5316\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u8c03\u8282\uff1a\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6587\u5316\u4e2d\u589e\u52a0\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u6587\u5316\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u53cd\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u4e86\"\u62df\u4eba\u5316AI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5fc5\u7136\u5e26\u6765\u98ce\u9669\"\u7684\u4e3b\u6d41\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b-AI\u4ea4\u4e92\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u6587\u5316\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u590d\u6742\u666f\u89c2\u3002\u8fd9\u8981\u6c42AI\u6cbb\u7406\u5fc5\u987b\u8d85\u8d8a\"\u4e00\u5200\u5207\"\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6587\u5316\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u52a0\u7ec6\u81f4\u5165\u5fae\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that better compliance with compute laws yields consistently improved reasoning performance on multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.

Current workflows compute curvature information during training, discard it, then recompute similar information for merging -- wasting computation and discarding valuable trajectory data. We introduce a unified framework that maintains factorized momentum and curvature statistics during training, then reuses this information for geometry-aware model composition. The proposed method achieves memory efficiency comparable to state-of-the-art approaches while accumulating task saliency scores that enable curvature-aware merging without post-hoc Fisher computation. We establish convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives with approximation error bounded by gradient singular value decay. On natural language understanding benchmarks, curvature-aware parameter selection outperforms magnitude-only baselines across all sparsity levels, with multi-task merging improving over strong baselines. The proposed framework exhibits rank-invariant convergence and superior hyperparameter robustness compared to existing low-rank optimizers. By treating the optimization trajectory as a reusable asset rather than discarding it, our approach eliminates redundant computation while enabling more principled model composition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ef4\u62a4\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u66f2\u7387\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91cd\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u91cd\u590d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u66f2\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u540e\u4e22\u5f03\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65f6\u91cd\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d6a\u8d39\u5e76\u4e22\u5931\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u5229\u7528\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u7ef4\u62a4\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u66f2\u7387\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u79ef\u7d2f\u4efb\u52a1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u66f2\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65e0\u9700\u540e\u9a8cFisher\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u975e\u51f8\u76ee\u6807\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u66f2\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u5728\u6240\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0a\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e45\u5ea6\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5408\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u79e9\u4e0d\u53d8\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u8d44\u4ea7\u800c\u975e\u4e22\u5f03\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5408\u5e76\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This makes them particularly useful for applications like image retrieval, report generation, and classification in clinical settings. A potential issue to this approach is that CLIP-based models often under perform when interpreting negated phrases, which is especially problematic in the context of medical diagnosing. In this study, we evaluate the Stanford AIMI CheXagent model on its ability to correctly retrieve chest X-ray images using prompts with and without negation. The goal of this project is to understand where this model fails and then use it as a base model to improve its retrieval accuracy by fine tuning methods outlined in previous work. Results from this study show improvement in handling of negation in the CLIP model with a slight decrease in accuracy of positive prompt evaluation. Alongside retrieval accuracy, we examined internal model behavior through token attribution, t-SNE projection, and attention-head ablation to better characterize how each fine tuning approach reshaped the text encoders representation of negated clinical language. Through this work, we hope to better understand the internal behavior of CLIP and improve its handling of negation using clinically relevant language for improving its reliability in medical AI devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86CheXagent\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u5426\u5b9a\u77ed\u8bed\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u8bed\u53e5\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982CLIP\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5426\u5b9a\u77ed\u8bed\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u8bca\u65ad\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c24\u5176\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Stanford AIMI CheXagent\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u6709\u65e0\u5426\u5b9a\u8bcd\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u68c0\u7d22\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7token\u5f52\u56e0\u3001t-SNE\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u6d88\u878d\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u5426\u5b9a\u8bed\u53e5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u6b63\u4f8b\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u5851\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u8bed\u8a00\u6539\u8fdb\u5176\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u8bed\u53e5\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u5728\u533b\u5b66AI\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

How such distributed control gives rise to precise global patterns remains a central question not only in developmental biology but also in distributed robotics, programmable matter, and multi-agent learning. Here, we introduce DiffeoMorph, an end-to-end differentiable framework for learning a morphogenesis protocol that guides a population of agents to morph into a target 3D shape. Each agent updates its position and internal state using an attention-based SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network, based on its own internal state and signals received from other agents. To train this system, we introduce a new shape-matching loss based on the 3D Zernike polynomials, which compares the predicted and target shapes as continuous spatial distributions, not as discrete point clouds, and is invariant to agent ordering, number of agents, and rigid-body transformations. To enforce full SO(3) invariance -- invariant to rotations yet sensitive to reflections, we include an alignment step that optimally rotates the predicted Zernike spectrum to match the target before computing the loss. This results in a bilevel problem, with the inner loop optimizing a unit quaternion for the best alignment and the outer loop updating the agent model. We compute gradients through the alignment step using implicit differentiation. We perform systematic benchmarking to establish the advantages of our shape-matching loss over other standard distance metrics for shape comparison tasks. We then demonstrate that DiffeoMorph can form a range of shapes -- from simple ellipsoids to complex morphologies -- using only minimal spatial cues.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiffeoMorph\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u5f62\u6001\u53d1\u751f\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u4e00\u7fa4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f62\u6210\u76ee\u68073D\u5f62\u72b6\u3002\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684SE(3)-\u7b49\u53d8\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D Zernike\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u692d\u7403\u4f53\u5230\u590d\u6742\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u5f62\u72b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u5f62\u6210\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u4ea7\u751f\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u53d1\u80b2\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u7269\u8d28\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5f62\u6001\u53d1\u751f\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7fa4\u4f53\u5f62\u6210\u76ee\u68073D\u5f62\u72b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165DiffeoMorph\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684SE(3)-\u7b49\u53d8\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u66f4\u65b0\u5176\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e3D Zernike\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7684\u65b0\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u72b6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5236\u5b8c\u5168SO(3)\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u635f\u5931\u524d\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u7684Zernike\u8c31\u6700\u4f18\u65cb\u8f6c\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5185\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u5355\u4f4d\u56db\u5143\u6570\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5916\u5c42\u66f4\u65b0\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9690\u5f0f\u5fae\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u9f50\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6807\u51c6\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u5f62\u72b6\u6bd4\u8f83\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u6f14\u793a\u4e86DiffeoMorph\u80fd\u591f\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\u5f62\u6210\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u692d\u7403\u4f53\u5230\u590d\u6742\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u5f62\u72b6\u3002", "conclusion": "DiffeoMorph\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5f62\u6001\u53d1\u751f\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7fa4\u4f53\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5f62\u6210\u76ee\u68073D\u5f62\u72b6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u548c\u7b49\u53d8\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u5f62\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These two recent algorithmic approaches improve the performance of base optimizers, such as AdamW, through different iterate averaging strategies. Schedule-Free explicitly maintains a uniform average of past weights, while single-worker DiLoCo performs implicit averaging by periodically aggregating trajectories, called pseudo-gradients, to update the model parameters. However, single-worker DiLoCo's periodic averaging introduces a two-loop structure, increasing its memory requirements and number of hyperparameters. GPA overcomes these limitations by decoupling the interpolation constant in the primal averaging formulation of Nesterov. This decoupling enables GPA to smoothly average iterates at every step, generalizing and improving upon single-worker DiLoCo. Empirically, GPA consistently outperforms single-worker DiLoCo while removing the two-loop structure, simplifying hyperparameter tuning, and reducing its memory overhead to a single additional buffer. On the Llama-160M model, GPA provides a 24.22% speedup in terms of steps to reach the baseline (AdamW's) validation loss. Likewise, GPA achieves speedups of 12% and 27% on small and large batch setups, respectively, to attain AdamW's validation accuracy on the ImageNet ViT workload. Furthermore, we prove that for any base optimizer with regret bounded by $O(\\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations, GPA can match or exceed the convergence guarantee of the original optimizer, depending on the choice of interpolation constants.", "AI": {"tldr": "GPA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026Nesterov\u539f\u59cb\u5e73\u5747\u516c\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u63d2\u503c\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bcf\u6b65\u5e73\u6ed1\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005DiLoCo\u548cSchedule-Free\u7b49\u5e73\u5747\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd1\u671f\u5e73\u5747\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08\u5982\u5355\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005DiLoCo\u548cSchedule-Free\uff09\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\u3002\u5355\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005DiLoCo\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5e73\u5747\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\uff1bSchedule-Free\u867d\u7136\u7ef4\u62a4\u5747\u5300\u5e73\u5747\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e7f\u4e49\u539f\u59cb\u5e73\u5747\uff08GPA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026Nesterov\u539f\u59cb\u5e73\u5747\u516c\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u63d2\u503c\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u5e73\u6ed1\u5730\u5e73\u5747\u8fed\u4ee3\u70b9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a8\u5e7f\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u5355\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005DiLoCo\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728Llama-160M\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cGPA\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08AdamW\uff09\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u6240\u9700\u6b65\u6570\u51cf\u5c1124.22%\uff1b\u5728ImageNet ViT\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u548c\u5927\u6279\u91cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u83b7\u5f9712%\u548c27%\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u81f3\u5355\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u3002", "conclusion": "GPA\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u63d2\u503c\u5e38\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fed\u4ee3\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5177\u6709O(\u221aT)\u9057\u61be\u754c\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Our goal is to achieve a globally stable and interference-aware channel allocation. Stability is defined through a generalized Gale-Shapley multi-to-one matching, a well-established solution concept in wireless resource allocation. We consider wireless networks where L cells share S orthogonal channels and cannot simultaneously use the same channel as their neighbors. Each channel evolves as an unknown restless Markov process with cell-dependent rewards, making this the first work to establish global Gale-Shapley stability for channel allocation in a stochastic, temporally varying restless environment. To address this challenge, we develop SMILE (Stable Multi-matching with Interference-aware LEarning), a communication-efficient distributed learning algorithm that integrates restless bandit learning with graph-constrained coordination. SMILE enables cells to distributedly balance exploration of unknown channels with exploitation of learned information. We prove that SMILE converges to the optimal stable allocation and achieves logarithmic regret relative to a genie with full knowledge of expected utilities.

This enables the efficient use of modern training techniques optimized for such networks. All parameters of the basis functions, including shape, location, and amplitude, are fully trainable. Model parsimony and h-adaptivity are effectively achieved through dynamically pruning basis functions during training. BumpNet is a general framework that can be combined with existing neural architectures for learning PDE solutions: here, we propose Bump-PINNs (BumpNet with physics-informed neural networks) for solving general PDEs; Bump-EDNN (BumpNet with evolutionary deep neural networks) to solve time-evolution PDEs; and Bump-DeepONet (BumpNet with deep operator networks) for PDE operator learning. Bump-PINNs are trained using the same collocation-based approach used by PINNs, Bump-EDNN uses a BumpNet only in the spatial domain and uses EDNNs to advance the solution in time, while Bump-DeepONets employ a BumpNet regression network as the trunk network of a DeepONet.

This degradation can be attributed to distribution shifts, including user, character, and dialogue compositional shifts. Existing methods like LLM-as-a-judge fall short in providing a fine-grained diagnosis of how these shifts affect RPM generalization, and thus there lack formal frameworks to characterize RPM generalization behaviors. To bridge these gaps, we introduce an information-theoretic metric, named reasoning-based effective mutual information difference (R-EMID), to measure RPM performance degradation in an interpretable way. We also derive an upper bound on R-EMID to predict the worst-case generalization performance of RPMs and theoretically reveal how various shifts contribute to the RPM performance degradation. Moreover, we propose a co-evolving reinforcement learning framework to adaptively model the connection among user, character, and dialogue context and thus enhance the estimation of dialogue response generation probability, which is critical for calculating R-EMID. Finally, we evaluate the generalization performance of various RPMs using R-EMID, finding that user shift poses the highest risk among all shifts and reinforcement learning is the most effective approach for enhancing RPM generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5ea6\u91cfR-EMID\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u9000\u5316\u6e90\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff08\u7528\u6237\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7ec4\u5408\u504f\u79fb\uff09\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b63\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8868\u5f81RPM\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5ea6\u91cfR-EMID\uff08\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u5dee\u5f02\uff09\u6765\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5730\u6d4b\u91cfRPM\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\uff1b2. \u63a8\u5bfcR-EMID\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u8bdd\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u6982\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5404\u79cdRPM\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u504f\u79fb\u5728\u6240\u6709\u504f\u79fb\u4e2d\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u589e\u5f3aRPM\u6cdb\u5316\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "R-EMID\u4e3a\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Although data-driven models have shown promise, their performance often deteriorates when the geometric structures governing long-term behavior are unknown or poorly represented. We demonstrate that a simple kernel ridge regression (KRR) framework, when combined with a dynamics-aware validation strategy, provides a strong baseline for long-term prediction of complex dynamical systems. By employing a data-driven kernel derived from diffusion maps, the proposed Diffusion Maps Kernel Ridge Regression (DM-KRR) method implicitly adapts to the intrinsic geometry of the system's invariant set, without requiring explicit manifold reconstruction or attractor modeling, procedures that often limit predictive performance. Across a broad range of systems, including smooth manifolds, chaotic attractors, and high-dimensional spatiotemporal flows, DM-KRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art random feature, neural-network and operator-learning methods in both accuracy and data efficiency. These findings underscore that long-term predictive skill depends not only on model expressiveness, but critically on respecting the geometric constraints encoded in the data through dynamically consistent model selection. Together, simplicity, geometry awareness, and strong empirical performance point to a promising path for reliable and efficient learning of complex dynamical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "DM-KRR\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6620\u5c04\u6838\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u671f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u672a\u77e5\u6216\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u4f73\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6269\u6563\u6620\u5c04\u6838\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\uff08DM-KRR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6838\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u6d41\u5f62\u91cd\u5efa\u6216\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u53d8\u96c6\u7684\u5185\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u62ec\u5149\u6ed1\u6d41\u5f62\u3001\u6df7\u6c8c\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u6d41\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cDM-KRR\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u66f4\u5173\u952e\u7684\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u5c0a\u91cd\u6570\u636e\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u3002DM-KRR\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

As a result, predicting EV charging demand has become a timely and important research problem. While substantial research has addressed energy load forecasting in transportation, relatively few studies systematically compare multiple forecasting methods across different temporal horizons and spatial aggregation levels in diverse urban settings. This work investigates the effectiveness of five time series forecasting models, ranging from traditional statistical approaches to machine learning and deep learning methods. Forecasting performance is evaluated for short-, mid-, and long-term horizons (on the order of minutes, hours, and days, respectively), and across spatial scales ranging from individual charging stations to regional and city-level aggregations. The analysis is conducted on four publicly available real-world datasets, with results reported independently for each dataset.

However, there is not a consistent definition or test to demonstrate inherent explainability. Work to date either characterises explainability through metrics, or appeals to intuition - \"we know it when we see it\". We propose a globally applicable criterion for inherent explainability. The criterion uses graph theory for representing and decomposing models for structure-local explanation, and recomposing them into global explanations. We form the structure-local explanations as annotations, a verifiable hypothesis-evidence structure that allows for a range of explanatory methods to be used. This criterion matches existing intuitions on inherent explainability, and provides justifications why a large regression model may not be explainable but a sparse neural network could be. We differentiate explainable -- a model that allows for explanation -- and \\textit{explained} -- one that has a verified explanation. Finally, we provide a full explanation of PREDICT -- a Cox proportional hazards model of cardiovascular disease risk, which is in active clinical use in New Zealand. It follows that PREDICT is inherently explainable. This work provides structure to formalise other work on explainability, and allows regulators a flexible but rigorous test that can be used in compliance frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u8bba\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5df2\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u4e34\u5e8a\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578bPREDICT\u4e3a\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f4\u89c9\u5224\u65ad\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u5c40\u9002\u7528\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u8bba\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5047\u8bbe-\u8bc1\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91cd\u65b0\u7ec4\u5408\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u533a\u5206\"\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\"\uff08\u5141\u8bb8\u89e3\u91ca\uff09\u548c\"\u5df2\u89e3\u91ca\"\uff08\u5177\u6709\u5df2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u91ca\uff09\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u56fa\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u76f4\u89c9\u76f8\u7b26\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5927\u578b\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u800c\u7a00\u758f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u80fd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u6210\u529f\u4e3a\u65b0\u897f\u5170\u4e34\u5e8a\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578bPREDICT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5177\u6709\u56fa\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u800c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u5408\u89c4\u3002"}}

However, real-world QoS data are extremely sparse, noisy, and shaped by hierarchical dependencies arising from QoS interactions, and geographical and network-level factors, making accurate QoS prediction challenging. Existing methods often predict each QoS parameter separately, requiring multiple similar models, which increases computational cost and leads to poor generalization. Although recent joint QoS prediction studies have explored shared architectures, they suffer from negative transfer due to loss-scaling caused by inconsistent numerical ranges across QoS parameters and further struggle with inadequate representation learning, resulting in degraded accuracy. This paper presents an unified strategy for joint QoS prediction, called SHARP-QoS, that addresses these issues using three components. First, we introduce a dual mechanism to extract the hierarchical features from both QoS and contextual structures via hyperbolic convolution formulated in the Poincar\u00e9 ball. Second, we propose an adaptive feature-sharing mechanism that allows feature exchange across informative QoS and contextual signals. A gated feature fusion module is employed to support dynamic feature selection among structural and shared representations. Third, we design an EMA-based loss balancing strategy that allows stable joint optimization, thereby mitigating the negative transfer.

However, their deployment at the edge across distributed compute nodes (cloudlets) createssubstantial communication overhead due to repeated transmission of overlapping node features between neighbouring cloudlets. To address this, we propose an adaptive pruning algorithm that dynamically filters redundant neighbour features while preserving the most informative spatial context for prediction. The algorithm adjusts pruning rates based on recent model performance, allowing each cloudlet to focus on regions experiencing traffic changes without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we introduce the Sudden Event Prediction Accuracy (SEPA), a novel event-focused metric designed to measure responsiveness to traffic slowdowns and recoveries, which are often missed by standard error metrics. We evaluate our approach in an online semi-decentralized setting with traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning on two large-scale traffic datasets, PeMS-BAY and PeMSD7-M, across short-, mid-, and long-term prediction horizons. Experiments show that, in contrast to standard metrics, SEPA exposes the true value of spatial connectivity in predicting dynamic and irregular traffic.

While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to state similarity between multiple MDPs remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to extend BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of well-established mathematical properties has limited further theoretical analysis between MDPs. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) for measuring state similarity between arbitrary pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with three fundamental metric properties, i.e., GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and a distance bound on identical spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyze policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation across MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than existing ones derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM.

Code available in https://github.com/jjgonzalez2491/MARLEY_V1", "summary": "Electricity systems are key to transforming today's society into a carbon-free economy. Long-term electricity market mechanisms, including auctions, support schemes, and other policy instruments, are critical in shaping the electricity generation mix. In light of the need for more advanced tools to support policymakers and other stakeholders in designing, testing, and evaluating long-term markets, this work presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning model capable of capturing the key features of decarbonizing energy systems. Profit-maximizing generation companies make investment decisions in the wholesale electricity market, responding to system needs, competitive dynamics, and policy signals. The model employs independent proximal policy optimization, which was selected for suitability to the decentralized and competitive environment. Nevertheless, given the inherent challenges of independent learning in multi-agent settings, an extensive hyperparameter search ensures that decentralized training yields market outcomes consistent with competitive behavior.

Classical methods for solving IDEs require repeatedly evaluating convolution integrals, whose cost increases quickly with kernel complexity and dimensionality. Existing neural solvers can accelerate selected instances of these computations, yet they do not generalize across diverse nonlocal structures. In this work, we introduce the Memory-Informed Neural Pseudo-Operator (MINPO), a unified framework for modeling nonlocal dynamics arising from long-range spatial interactions and/or long-term temporal memory. MINPO, employing either Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) or multilayer perceptron networks (MLPs) as encoders, learns the nonlocal operator and its inverse directly through neural representations, and then explicitly reconstruct the unknown solution fields. The learning is guarded by a lightweight nonlocal consistency loss term to enforce coherence between the learned operator and reconstructed solution. The MINPO formulation allows to naturally capture and efficiently resolve nonlocal spatiotemporal dependencies governed by a wide spectrum of IDEs and their subsets, including fractional PDEs. We evaluate the efficacy of MINPO in comparison with classical techniques and state-of-the-art neural-based strategies based on MLPs, such as A-PINN and fPINN, along with their newly-developed KAN variants, A-PIKAN and fPIKAN, designed to facilitate a fair comparison. Our study offers compelling evidence of the accuracy of MINPO and demonstrates its robustness in handling (i) diverse kernel types, (ii) different kernel dimensionalities, and (iii) the substantial computational demands arising from repeated evaluations of kernel integrals. MINPO, thus, generalizes beyond problem-specific formulations, providing a unified framework for systems governed by nonlocal operators.", "AI": {"tldr": "MINPO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u4f2a\u7b97\u5b50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u7531\u957f\u7a0b\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c/\u6216\u957f\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u7b97\u5b50\u53ca\u5176\u9006\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u91cd\u6784\u672a\u77e5\u89e3\u573a\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7531\u79ef\u5206\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u7a7a\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u590d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5377\u79ef\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u5176\u6210\u672c\u968f\u6838\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u7279\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "MINPO\u4f7f\u7528KANs\u6216MLPs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u7b97\u5b50\u53ca\u5176\u9006\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u663e\u5f0f\u91cd\u6784\u672a\u77e5\u89e3\u573a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u9879\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0e\u91cd\u6784\u89e3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u6280\u672f\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eMLPs\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u795e\u7ecf\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982A-PINN\u3001fPINN\u53ca\u5176KAN\u53d8\u4f53A-PIKAN\u3001fPIKAN\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cMINPO\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u6838\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u6838\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u91cd\u590d\u6838\u79ef\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MINPO\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u53d7\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u7b97\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u7136\u6355\u83b7\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7531\u5e7f\u6cdbIDE\u8c31\u53ca\u5176\u5b50\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u6570PDE\uff09\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Clinical assessments are expensive and invasive, leaving ground truth labels available for only a fraction of neuroimaging datasets. We introduce Multi view Adaptive Transport Clustering for Heterogeneous Alzheimer's Disease (MATCH-AD), a semi supervised framework that integrates deep representation learning, graph-based label propagation, and optimal transport theory to address this limitation. The framework leverages manifold structure in neuroimaging data to propagate diagnostic information from limited labeled samples to larger unlabeled populations, while using Wasserstein distances to quantify disease progression between cognitive states. Evaluated on nearly five thousand subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, encompassing structural MRI measurements from hundreds of brain regions, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and clinical variables MATCHAD achieves near-perfect diagnostic accuracy despite ground truth labels for less than one-third of subjects. The framework substantially outperforms all baseline methods, achieving kappa indicating almost perfect agreement compared to weak agreement for the best baseline, a qualitative transformation in diagnostic reliability. Performance remains clinically useful even under severe label scarcity, and we provide theoretical convergence guarantees with proven bounds on label propagation error and transport stability.

Lite-STGNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on four benchmark datasets for horizons up to 720 steps, while being parameter-efficient and substantially faster to train than transformer-based methods. Ablation studies show that the spatial module yields 4.6% improvement over the temporal baseline, Top-$K$ enhances locality by 3.3%, and learned adjacency matrices reveal domain-specific interaction dynamics.

We introduce SafeBench-Seq, a metadata-only, reproducible benchmark and baseline classifier built entirely from public data (SafeProtein hazards and UniProt benigns) and interpretable features (global physicochemical descriptors and amino-acid composition). To approximate \"never-before-seen\" threats, we homology-cluster the combined dataset at <=40% identity and perform cluster-level holdouts (no cluster overlap between train/test). We report discrimination (AUROC/AUPRC) and screening-operating points (TPR@1% FPR; FPR@95% TPR) with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals (n=200), and we provide calibrated probabilities via CalibratedClassifierCV (isotonic for Logistic Regression / Random Forest; Platt sigmoid for Linear SVM). We quantify probability quality using Brier score, Expected Calibration Error (ECE; 15 bins), and reliability diagrams. Shortcut susceptibility is probed via composition-preserving residue shuffles and length-/composition-only ablations. Empirically, random splits substantially overestimate robustness relative to homology-clustered evaluation; calibrated linear models exhibit comparatively good calibration, while tree ensembles retain slightly higher Brier/ECE.

Through activation patching experiments across 9 models from 7 Transformer families plus Mamba (370M-13B parameters), we establish three key findings:\n  1. Double dissociation: Task Schema transfers at 100% via late MLP patching; Binding transfers at 62% via residual stream patching -- proving separable mechanisms\n  2. Prior-Schema trade-off: Schema reliance inversely correlates with prior knowledge (Spearman rho = -0.596, p < 0.001, N=28 task-model pairs)\n  3. Architecture generality: The mechanism operates across all tested architectures including the non-Transformer Mamba\n  These findings offer a mechanistic account of the ICL puzzle that contrasts with prior views treating ICL as a monolithic mechanism (whether retrieval-based, gradient descent-like, or purely Bayesian). By establishing that Schema and Binding are neurally dissociable -- not merely behavioral modes -- we provide causal evidence for dual-process theories of ICL. Models rely on Task Schema when prior knowledge is absent, but prior knowledge interferes through attentional mis-routing (72.7% recency bias) rather than direct output competition (0%). This explains why arbitrary mappings succeed (zero prior leads to full Schema reliance) while factual overrides fail -- and reveals that the true bottleneck is attentional, not output-level. Practical implications: Understanding these dual mechanisms enables more efficient prompt engineering -- reliable schema transfer reduces required demonstrations for novel tasks, while prior-aware design can mitigate the 38% binding failure rate in high-prior scenarios, improving ICL system reliability in production deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u5f0f\u548c\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u8d1f\u8d23\u62bd\u8c61\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5904\u7406\u5177\u4f53\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5173\u8054\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u673a\u5236\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5c42\u9762\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u4e14\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u673a\u5236\uff08\u68c0\u7d22\u5f0f\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5f0f\u6216\u7eaf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f0f\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u5426\u7531\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u53cc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4fee\u8865\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57289\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6765\u81ea7\u4e2aTransformer\u5bb6\u65cf\u548cMamba\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21370M-13B\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u665a\u671fMLP\u4fee\u8865\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u5f0f100%\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u4fee\u8865\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed1\u5b9a62%\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u3002\u5206\u679028\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1-\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "result": "1. \u53d1\u73b0\u53cc\u91cd\u5206\u79bb\uff1a\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u5f0f\u901a\u8fc7\u665a\u671fMLP\u4fee\u8865100%\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u7ed1\u5b9a\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u4fee\u886562%\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e24\u4e2a\u673a\u5236\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5c42\u9762\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\n2. \u5148\u9a8c-\u56fe\u5f0f\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5448\u663e\u8457\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff08Spearman rho = -0.596, p < 0.001\uff09\n3. \u67b6\u6784\u666e\u9002\u6027\uff1a\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u975eTransformer\u7684Mamba\u6a21\u578b", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7531\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u5f0f\u548c\u7ed1\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u53cc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u5f53\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bef\u8def\u7531\uff0872.7%\u8fd1\u56e0\u504f\u5dee\uff09\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u8f93\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\uff080%\uff09\u4ea7\u751f\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4efb\u610f\u6620\u5c04\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u800c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8986\u76d6\u4f1a\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u9762\u800c\u975e\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u9762\u3002\u5b9e\u8df5\u610f\u4e49\uff1a\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53cc\u91cd\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Building on gradient accumulation with micro-batches, this paper introduces GreedySnake, a new SSD-offloaded training system that employs vertical scheduling, which executes all microbatches of a layer before proceeding to the next. Compared to existing systems that use horizontal scheduling (i.e., executing micro-batches sequentially), GreedySnake achieves higher training throughput with smaller batch sizes, bringing the system much closer to the ideal scenario predicted by the roofline model. To further mitigate the I/O bottleneck, GreedySnake overlaps part of the optimization step with the forward pass of the next iteration.

Machine learning (ML) models are widely adopted to detect such content; however, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, wherein malicious users subtly modify text to evade detection. Enhancing adversarial robustness is therefore essential, requiring detectors that can defend against diverse attacks (generalizability) while maintaining high overall accuracy. However, simultaneously achieving both optimal generalizability and accuracy is challenging. Following the computational design science paradigm, this study takes a sequential approach that first proposes a novel framework (Large Language Model-based Sample Generation and Aggregation, LLM-SGA) by identifying the key invariances of textual adversarial attacks and leveraging them to ensure that a detector instantiated within the framework has strong generalizability. Second, we instantiate our detector (Adversarially Robust Harmful Online Content Detector, ARHOCD) with three novel design components to improve detection accuracy: (1) an ensemble of multiple base detectors that exploits their complementary strengths; (2) a novel weight assignment method that dynamically adjusts weights based on each sample's predictability and each base detector's capability, with weights initialized using domain knowledge and updated via Bayesian inference; and (3) a novel adversarial training strategy that iteratively optimizes both the base detectors and the weight assignor. We addressed several limitations of existing adversarial robustness enhancement research and empirically evaluated ARHOCD across three datasets spanning hate speech, rumor, and extremist content.

In realistic settings, interventions are rarely isolated: organizations need to align sequences of interventions to jointly steer the outcome of a case. Existing PresPM approaches fall short in this respect. Many focus on a single intervention decision, while others treat multiple interventions independently, ignoring how they interact over time. Methods that do address these dependencies depend either on simulation or data augmentation to approximate the process to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, which can create a reality gap and introduce bias. We introduce SCOPE, a PresPM approach that learns aligned sequential intervention recommendations. SCOPE employs backward induction to estimate the effect of each candidate intervention action, propagating its impact from the final decision point back to the first. By leveraging causal learners, our method can utilize observational data directly, unlike methods that require constructing process approximations for reinforcement learning. Experiments on both an existing synthetic dataset and a new semi-synthetic dataset show that SCOPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PresPM techniques in optimizing the KPI.

We show that these judge systems exhibit a recurring vulnerability: short sequences of low-perplexity control tokens can flip many binary evaluations from correct ``No'' judgments to incorrect ``Yes'' judgments by steering the last-layer logit gap. These control tokens are patterns that a policy model could plausibly generate during post-training, and thus represent realistic reward-hacking risks rather than worst-case adversarial strings. Our method, AdvJudge-Zero, uses the model's next-token distribution and beam-search exploration to discover diverse control-token sequences from scratch, and our analysis shows that the induced hidden-state perturbations concentrate in a low-rank ``soft mode'' that is anti-aligned with the judge's refusal direction. Empirically, these tokens cause very high false positive rates when large open-weight and specialized judge models score incorrect answers on math and reasoning benchmarks.

We address this inefficiency with TRAPO (\\textbf{T}rust-\\textbf{R}egion \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{P}olicy \\textbf{O}ptimization), a hybrid framework that interleaves SFT and RL within each training instance by optimizing SFT loss on expert prefixes and RL loss on the model's own completions, unifying external supervision and self-exploration. To stabilize training, we introduce Trust-Region SFT (TrSFT), which minimizes forward KL divergence inside a trust region but attenuates optimization outside, effectively shifting toward reverse KL and yielding stable, mode-seeking updates favorable for RL. An adaptive prefix-selection mechanism further allocates expert guidance based on measured utility. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that TRAPO consistently surpasses standard SFT, RL, and SFT-then-RL pipelines, as well as recent state-of-the-art approaches, establishing a strong new paradigm for reasoning-enhanced LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "TRAPO\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06SFT\u548cRL\u4ea4\u9519\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57dfSFT\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u5148SFT\u540eRL\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1aSFT\u7684\u521a\u6027\u6a21\u4eff\u4f1a\u6291\u5236\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86RL\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f4e\u6548\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "TRAPO\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u4ea4\u9519\u8fdb\u884cSFT\u548cRL\uff1a\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u524d\u7f00\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316SFT\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u8865\u5168\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316RL\u635f\u5931\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57dfSFT\uff08TrSFT\uff09\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u524d\u5411KL\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u5916\u8870\u51cf\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8f6c\u5411\u53cd\u5411KL\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bfb\u6c42\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u524d\u7f00\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u6548\u7528\u5206\u914d\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTRAPO\u4e00\u81f4\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6807\u51c6SFT\u3001RL\u3001SFT-then-RL\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ee5\u53ca\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TRAPO\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In this setting, the owner of the network runs inference on the data of the client without learning anything about the data and without revealing any information about the model. It has been observed that a major computational bottleneck of PI is the calculation of the gate (i.e., ReLU), so a considerable amount of effort have been devoted to reducing the number of ReLUs in a given network.\n  We focus on the DReLU, which is the non-linear step function of the ReLU and show that one DReLU can serve many ReLU operations. We suggest a new activation module where the DReLU operation is only performed on a subset of the channels (Prototype channels), while the rest of the channels (replicate channels) replicates the DReLU of each of their neurons from the corresponding neurons in one of the prototype channels. We then extend this idea to work across different layers.\n  We show that this formulation can drastically reduce the number of DReLU operations in resnet type network. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis shows that this new formulation can solve an extended version of the XOR problem, using just one non-linearity and two neurons, something that traditional formulations and some PI specific methods cannot achieve.

However, most existing feature selection approaches either operate as multi-stage pipelines or rely on post hoc feature attribution, making selection and prediction weakly coupled. In this work, we present YOTO (you only train once), an end-to-end framework that jointly identifies discrete gene subsets and performs prediction within a single differentiable architecture. In our model, the prediction task directly guides which genes are selected, while the learned subsets, in turn, shape the predictive representation. This closed feedback loop enables the model to iteratively refine both what it selects and how it predicts during training. Unlike existing approaches, YOTO enforces sparsity so that only the selected genes contribute to inference, eliminating the need to train additional downstream classifiers. Through a multi-task learning design, the model learns shared representations across related objectives, allowing partially labeled datasets to inform one another, and discovering gene subsets that generalize across tasks without additional training steps. We evaluate YOTO on two representative single-cell RNA-seq datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Performing such analyses in a statistically rigorous manner is non-trivial, however. Appropriate performance metrics must be selected that allow for valid comparisons between groups of different sample sizes and base rates; metric uncertainty must be determined and multiple comparisons be corrected for, in order to assess whether any observed differences may be purely due to chance; and in the case of intersectional analyses, mechanisms must be implemented to find the most `interesting' subgroups within combinatorially many subgroup combinations. We here present a statistical toolbox that addresses these challenges and enables practitioners to easily yet rigorously assess their models for potential subgroup performance disparities. While broadly applicable, the toolbox is specifically designed for medical imaging applications. The analyses provided by the toolbox are illustrated in two case studies, one in skin lesion malignancy classification on the ISIC2020 dataset and one in chest X-ray-based disease classification on the MIMIC-CXR dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5b50\u7ec4\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u591a\u91cd\u6bd4\u8f83\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u5b50\u7ec4\u53d1\u73b0\u7b49\u7edf\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6309\u60a3\u8005\u548c\u8bb0\u5f55\u5c5e\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5c42\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u505a\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u91cd\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4ee5\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u6b64\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u4e0d\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u7387\u4e0d\u540c\u3001\u591a\u91cd\u6bd4\u8f83\u6821\u6b63\u7b49\u7edf\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u7387\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff1b2\uff09\u786e\u5b9a\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u91cd\u6bd4\u8f83\u6821\u6b63\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c2\u5bdf\u5dee\u5f02\u662f\u5426\u5076\u7136\uff1b4\uff09\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u5b50\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u627e\u5230\u6700\"\u6709\u8da3\"\u7684\u5b50\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\u5728ISIC2020\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u53d8\u6076\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u548cMIMIC-CXR\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u7c7b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5b50\u7ec4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\u4f7f\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u8f7b\u677e\u800c\u4e25\u8c28\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5b50\u7ec4\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a critical approach for effectively adapting LMs to a diverse range of downstream tasks. However, existing PEFT methods face two primary challenges: (1) High resource cost. Although PEFT methods significantly reduce resource demands compared to full fine-tuning, it still requires substantial time and memory, making it impractical in resource-constrained environments. (2) Parameter dependency. PEFT methods heavily rely on updating a subset of parameters associated with LMs to incorporate task-specific knowledge. Yet, due to increasing competition in the LMs landscape, many companies have adopted closed-source policies for their leading models, offering access only via Application Programming Interface (APIs). Whereas, the expense is often cost-prohibitive and difficult to sustain, as the fine-tuning process of LMs is extremely slow. Even if small models perform far worse than LMs in general, they can achieve superior results on particular distributions while requiring only minimal resources. Motivated by this insight, we propose Easy Adaptation (EA), which designs Specific Small Models (SSMs) to complement the underfitted data distribution for LMs. Extensive experiments show that EA matches the performance of PEFT on diverse tasks without accessing LM parameters, and requires only minimal resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEasy Adaptation\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5b9a\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8865\u5145\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u5145\u5206\u62df\u5408\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6781\u5c11\u8d44\u6e90\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a1) \u8d44\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\uff1b2) \u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbf\u95ee\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u800c\u8bb8\u591a\u9886\u5148\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u91c7\u7528\u95ed\u6e90API\u8bbf\u95ee\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7f13\u6162", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEasy Adaptation\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5b9a\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8865\u5145\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u5145\u5206\u62df\u5408\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u66f4\u65b0\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u80fd\u591f\u5339\u914d\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6781\u5c11\u7684\u8d44\u6e90", "conclusion": "EA\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5b9a\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8865\u5145\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u5145\u5206\u62df\u5408\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027"}}

These methods are typically formulated via overdamped or underdamped Ornstein--Uhlenbeck-type stochastic differential equations, in which sampling is driven by a combination of deterministic drift and Brownian diffusion, resulting in continuous particle trajectories in the ambient space. While such dynamics enjoy exponential convergence guarantees for strongly log-concave target distributions, it is well known that their mixing rates deteriorate exponentially in the presence of nonconvex or multimodal landscapes, such as double-well potentials. Since many practical generative modeling tasks involve highly non-log-concave target distributions, considerable recent effort has been devoted to developing sampling schemes that improve exploration beyond classical diffusion dynamics.\n  A promising line of work leverages tools from information geometry to augment diffusion-based samplers with controlled mass reweighting mechanisms. This perspective leads naturally to Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao (WFR) geometries, which couple transport in the sample space with vertical (reaction) dynamics on the space of probability measures. In this work, we formulate such reweighting mechanisms through the introduction of explicit correction terms and show how they can be implemented via weighted stochastic differential equations using the Feynman--Kac representation. Our study provides a preliminary but rigorous investigation of WFR-based sampling dynamics, and aims to clarify their geometric and operator-theoretic structure as a foundation for future theoretical and algorithmic developments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eWasserstein-Fisher-Rao\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u548c\u52a0\u6743\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u6216\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6570\u51f9\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u6216\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u5982\u53cc\u52bf\u9631\uff09\u4e0a\u6df7\u5408\u901f\u7387\u4f1a\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u6076\u5316\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u5bf9\u6570\u51f9\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao\u51e0\u4f55\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528Feynman-Kac\u8868\u793a\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eWFR\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao\u51e0\u4f55\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u51f8\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6837\u672c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u5782\u76f4\uff08\u53cd\u5e94\uff09\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Although Inconel 625 shows excellent creep resistance, finite-element creep simulations in tools such as ANSYS remain computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes for a single 10,000-hour run. This work proposes deep learning based surrogate models to provide fast and accurate replacements for such simulations. Creep strain data was generated in ANSYS using the Norton law under uniaxial stresses of 50 to 150 MPa and temperatures of 700 to 1000 $^\\circ$C, and this temporal dataset was used to train two architectures: a BiLSTM Variational Autoencoder for uncertainty-aware and generative predictions, and a BiLSTM Transformer hybrid that employs self-attention to capture long-range temporal behavior. Both models act as surrogate predictors, with the BiLSTM-VAE offering probabilistic output and the BiLSTM-Transformer delivering high deterministic accuracy. Performance is evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and $R^2$. Results show that the BiLSTM-VAE provides stable and reliable creep strain forecasts, while the BiLSTM-Transformer achieves strong accuracy across the full time range. Latency tests indicate substantial speedup: while each ANSYS simulation requires 30 to 40 minutes for a given stress-temperature condition, the surrogate models produce predictions within seconds. The proposed framework enables rapid creep assessment for design optimization and structural health monitoring, and provides a scalable solution for high-temperature alloy applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u4ee3Inconel 625\u5408\u91d1\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5143\u8815\u53d8\u6a21\u62df\uff0cBiLSTM-VAE\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff0cBiLSTM-Transformer\u63d0\u4f9b\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u6570\u5341\u5206\u949f\u5230\u79d2\u7ea7\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "Inconel 625\u7b49\u9ad8\u6e29\u5408\u91d1\u7684\u8815\u53d8\u53d8\u5f62\u5bf9\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u957f\u671f\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6a21\u62df\uff08\u5982ANSYS\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u5355\u6b2110,000\u5c0f\u65f6\u6a21\u62df\u9700\u8981\u6570\u5341\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ANSYS\u57fa\u4e8eNorton\u5b9a\u5f8b\u751f\u6210\u5355\u8f74\u5e94\u529b50-150 MPa\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6700-1000\u00b0C\u4e0b\u7684\u8815\u53d8\u5e94\u53d8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e24\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff1aBiLSTM\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u751f\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u548cBiLSTM-Transformer\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6355\u6349\u957f\u7a0b\u65f6\u95f4\u884c\u4e3a\uff09\u3002", "result": "BiLSTM-VAE\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8815\u53d8\u5e94\u53d8\u9884\u6d4b\uff0cBiLSTM-Transformer\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\uff1aANSYS\u6a21\u62df\u9700\u898130-40\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u800c\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d2\u7ea7\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6e29\u5408\u91d1\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u8815\u53d8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u9ad8\u6548\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002"}}

However, conventional implementations suffer from critical inter-layer isolation, where layers optimize goodness functions independently without leveraging collective learning dynamics. This isolation constrains representational coordination and limits convergence efficiency in deeper architectures. This paper introduces Collaborative Forward-Forward (CFF) learning, extending the original algorithm through inter-layer cooperation mechanisms that preserve forward-only computation while enabling global context integration. Our framework implements two collaborative paradigms: Fixed CFF (F-CFF) with constant inter-layer coupling and Adaptive CFF (A-CFF) with learnable collaboration parameters that evolve during training. The collaborative goodness function incorporates weighted contributions from all layers, enabling coordinated feature learning while maintaining memory efficiency and biological plausibility. Comprehensive evaluation on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST demonstrates significant performance improvements over baseline Forward-Forward implementations. These findings establish inter-layer collaboration as a fundamental enhancement to Forward-Forward learning, with immediate applicability to neuromorphic computing architectures and energy-constrained AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0f\u524d\u5411-\u524d\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u95f4\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u524d\u5411-\u524d\u5411\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5c42\u95f4\u9694\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u524d\u5411\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u524d\u5411-\u524d\u5411\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5c42\u95f4\u9694\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5404\u5c42\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\"goodness\"\u51fd\u6570\u800c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u96c6\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u6df1\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0f\u524d\u5411-\u524d\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u534f\u4f5c\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u56fa\u5b9aCFF\uff08\u6052\u5b9a\u5c42\u95f4\u8026\u5408\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94CFF\uff08\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u3002\u534f\u4f5cgoodness\u51fd\u6570\u6574\u5408\u6240\u6709\u5c42\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728MNIST\u548cFashion-MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u524d\u5411-\u524d\u5411\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u534f\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c42\u95f4\u534f\u4f5c\u662f\u524d\u5411-\u524d\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In such a direction, we focus on the family of Latent Space Models, and more specifically on the Latent Distance Model which naturally conveys important network characteristics such as homophily, transitivity, and the balance theory. Furthermore, this thesis aims to create structural-aware network representations, which lead to hierarchical expressions of network structure, community characterization, the identification of extreme profiles in networks, and impact dynamics quantification in temporal networks. Crucially, the methods presented are designed to define unified learning processes, eliminating the need for heuristics and multi-stage processes like post-processing steps. Our aim is to delve into a journey towards unified network embeddings that are both comprehensive and powerful, capable of characterizing network structures and adeptly handling the diverse tasks that graph analysis offers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u548c\u5355\u4e8b\u4ef6\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6f5c\u5728\u8ddd\u79bb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u521b\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u7136\u6355\u6349\u7f51\u7edc\u91cd\u8981\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u4f20\u9012\u6027\u3001\u5e73\u8861\u7406\u8bba\uff09\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6f5c\u5728\u8ddd\u79bb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7528\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u548c\u5355\u4e8b\u4ef6\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5c42\u6b21\u8868\u8fbe\u3001\u793e\u533a\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u6781\u7aef\u8f6e\u5ed3\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7f51\u7edc\u5f71\u54cd\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u5168\u9762\u4e14\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8868\u5f81\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Submitted to ICRA 2026", "summary": "Safe reinforcement learning (SafeRL) is a prominent paradigm for autonomous driving, where agents are required to optimize performance under strict safety requirements. This dual objective creates a fundamental tension, as overly conservative policies limit driving efficiency while aggressive exploration risks safety violations. The Safety Representations for Safer Policy Learning (SRPL) framework addresses this challenge by equipping agents with a predictive model of future constraint violations and has shown promise in controlled environments. This paper investigates whether SRPL extends to real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Systematic experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and NuPlan demonstrate that SRPL can improve the reward-safety tradeoff, achieving statistically significant improvements in success rate (effect sizes r = 0.65-0.86) and cost reduction (effect sizes r = 0.70-0.83), with p < 0.05 for observed improvements. However, its effectiveness depends on the underlying policy optimizer and the dataset distribution. The results further show that predictive safety representations play a critical role in improving robustness to observation noise. Additionally, in zero-shot cross-dataset evaluation, SRPL-augmented agents demonstrate improved generalization compared to non-SRPL methods. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential of predictive safety representations to strengthen SafeRL for autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "SRPL\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u5956\u52b1-\u5b89\u5168\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5e95\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u8981\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u77db\u76fe\uff1a\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f1a\u9650\u5236\u9a7e\u9a76\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u5219\u53ef\u80fd\u8fdd\u53cd\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u3002SRPL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728Waymo Open Motion Dataset\u548cNuPlan\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30SRPL\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5305\u62ec\u5956\u52b1-\u5b89\u5168\u6743\u8861\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7edf\u8ba1\u3001\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "SRPL\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5956\u52b1-\u5b89\u5168\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u91cfr=0.65-0.86\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u6548\u679c\u91cfr=0.70-0.83\uff08p<0.05\uff09\u3002\u4f46\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5e95\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u9884\u6d4b\u5b89\u5168\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0cSRPL\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u6d4b\u5b89\u5168\u8868\u793a\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0cSRPL\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

However, this performance is often dependent on the presence of large and varied datasets. In some settings, like in the medical domain, data is often fragmented across parties, and cannot be readily shared. While federated learning addresses this situation, it is a solution that requires synchronicity of parties training a single model together, exchanging information about model weights. We investigate how asynchronous collaboration, where only already trained models are shared (e.g. as part of a publication), affects performance, and propose to use stitching as a method for combining models.\n  Through taking a multi-objective perspective, where performance on each parties' data is viewed independently, we find that training solely on a single parties' data results in similar performance when merging with another parties' data, when considering performance on that single parties' data, while performance on other parties' data is notably worse. Moreover, while an ensemble of such individually trained networks generalizes better, performance on each parties' own dataset suffers. We find that combining intermediate representations in individually trained models with a well placed pair of stitching layers allows this performance to recover to a competitive degree while maintaining improved generalization, showing that asynchronous collaboration can yield competitive results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5f02\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5df2\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u7f1d\u5408\u5c42\u6280\u672f\u6765\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u4e0e\u65b9\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5404\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u540c\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u5f02\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\uff08\u4ec5\u5171\u4eab\u5df2\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f02\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u5404\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u7f1d\u5408\u5c42\u6280\u672f\u6765\u7ed3\u5408\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7f1d\u5408\u5c42\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u5404\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u72ec\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u8eab\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u4f46\u635f\u5bb3\u5404\u65b9\u81ea\u8eab\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7f1d\u5408\u5c42\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u5404\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f02\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f1d\u5408\u5c42\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5f02\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Firstly, we consider the case of neural networks with a single hidden layer and we derive an integral infinite width neural representation that generalizes existing continuous neural networks (CNNs) representations. Then we extend this to deep residual CNNs that have a finite number of integral hidden layers and residual connections. Secondly, we revisit the relation between neural ODEs and deep residual NNs and we formalize approximation errors via discretization techniques. Then, we merge these two approaches into a unified homogeneous representation of NNs as a Distributed Parameter neural Network (DiPaNet) and we show that most of the existing finite and infinite-dimensional NNs architectures are related via homogeneization/discretization with the DiPaNet representation. Our approach is purely deterministic and applies to general, uniformly continuous matrix weight functions.

This article extends known convergence guarantees of an algorithm operating in isolation (i.e., without disturbances) and systematically derives stability bounds and convergence rates in the presence of such disturbances. By leveraging converse Lyapunov theorems, we derive key inequalities that quantify the impact of disturbances. We further demonstrate how our result can be utilized to assess the effects of disturbances on algorithmic performance in a wide variety of applications, including communication constraints in distributed learning, sensitivity in machine learning generalization, and intentional noise injection for privacy.

Bakhvalov"], "title": "Polyharmonic Cascade", "comment": "Part 3 of 4 in the \"Polyharmonic Cascade\" cycle. Proposes a non-SGD training method based on global linear solvers. Previous papers: arXiv:2512.12731, arXiv.2512.16718. Source code is available at: https://github.com/xolod7/polyharmonic-cascade", "summary": "This paper presents a deep machine learning architecture, the \"polyharmonic cascade\" -- a sequence of packages of polyharmonic splines, where each layer is rigorously derived from the theory of random functions and the principles of indifference. This makes it possible to approximate nonlinear functions of arbitrary complexity while preserving global smoothness and a probabilistic interpretation. For the polyharmonic cascade, a training method alternative to gradient descent is proposed: instead of directly optimizing the coefficients, one solves a single global linear system on each batch with respect to the function values at fixed \"constellations\" of nodes. This yields synchronized updates of all layers, preserves the probabilistic interpretation of individual layers and theoretical consistency with the original model, and scales well: all computations reduce to 2D matrix operations efficiently executed on a GPU. Fast learning without overfitting on MNIST is demonstrated.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\"\u591a\u8c03\u548c\u7ea7\u8054\"\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\u539f\u7406\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u8c03\u548c\u6837\u6761\u5305\u5e8f\u5217\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4efb\u610f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u548c\u6982\u7387\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u5bfc\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u6982\u7387\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u8c03\u548c\u7ea7\u8054\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u7531\u591a\u8c03\u548c\u6837\u6761\u5305\u5e8f\u5217\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u6bcf\u5c42\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\u539f\u7406\u4e25\u683c\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6279\u6b21\u4e0a\u6c42\u89e3\u5173\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\"\u8282\u70b9\u661f\u5ea7\"\u5904\u51fd\u6570\u503c\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u5c42\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e14\u4e0d\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6240\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u5728GPU\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u6267\u884c\u76842D\u77e9\u9635\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u8c03\u548c\u7ea7\u8054\u67b6\u6784\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u6982\u7387\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While Gaussian processes offer theoretical consistency and exact uncertainty quantification, their prohibitive computational scaling renders them impractical for massive sensor networks. Conversely, modern transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling but inherently lack a geometric inductive bias, treating spatial sensors as permutation-invariant tokens without a native understanding of distance. In this work, we propose a spatially-informed transformer, a hybrid architecture that injects a geostatistical inductive bias directly into the self-attention mechanism via a learnable covariance kernel. By formally decomposing the attention structure into a stationary physical prior and a non-stationary data-driven residual, we impose a soft topological constraint that favors spatially proximal interactions while retaining the capacity to model complex dynamics. We demonstrate the phenomenon of ``Deep Variography'', where the network successfully recovers the true spatial decay parameters of the underlying process end-to-end via backpropagation. Extensive experiments on synthetic Gaussian random fields and real-world traffic benchmarks confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks.

However, this process often leads to catastrophic forgetting of the model's prior domain knowledge. We address this issue with LaLoRA, a weight-space regularization technique that applies a Laplace approximation to Low-Rank Adaptation. Our approach estimates the model's confidence in each parameter and constrains updates in high-curvature directions, preserving prior knowledge while enabling efficient target-domain learning.

In this work, we propose a plug-and-play calibratable disambiguation loss (CDL) that simultaneously improves classification accuracy and calibration performance. The loss has two instantiations: the first one calibrates predictions based on probabilities from the candidate label set, while the second one integrates probabilities from both candidate and non-candidate label sets. The proposed CDL can be seamlessly incorporated into existing MIPL and PLL frameworks. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes the lower bound and regularization properties of CDL, demonstrating its superiority over conventional disambiguation losses.

To do so, several works completely replace ID embeddings with modality embeddings, claiming that modality embeddings render ID embeddings unnecessary because they can match or even exceed ID embedding performance. On the other hand, many works jointly utilize ID and modality features, but posit that complex fusion strategies, such as multi-stage training and/or intricate alignment architectures, are necessary for this joint utilization. However, underlying both these lines of work is a lack of understanding of the complementarity of ID and modality features. In this work, we address this gap by studying the complementarity of ID- and text-based SR models. We show that these models do learn complementary signals, meaning that either should provide performance gain when used properly alongside the other. Motivated by this, we propose a new SR method that preserves ID-text complementarity through independent model training, then harnesses it through a simple ensembling strategy. Despite this method's simplicity, we show it outperforms several competitive SR baselines, implying that both ID and text features are necessary to achieve state-of-the-art SR performance but complex fusion architectures are not.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0ID\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u5c31\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u4e48\u5b8c\u5168\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u66ff\u4ee3ID\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u91c7\u7528\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u8054\u5408\u4f7f\u7528ID\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9ID\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3ID\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u4f46\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u660eID\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u90fd\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7684\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "ID\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c31\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u7684\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

Kernel-based operator learning can offer accurate, theoretically justified approximations that require less training than standard methods. However, they can become computationally prohibitive for large training sets and can be sensitive to noise. We propose a regularized random Fourier feature (RRFF) approach, coupled with a finite element reconstruction map (RRFF-FEM), for learning operators from noisy data. The method uses random features drawn from multivariate Student's $t$ distributions, together with frequency-weighted Tikhonov regularization that suppresses high-frequency noise. We establish high-probability bounds on the extreme singular values of the associated random feature matrix and show that when the number of features $N$ scales like $m \\log m$ with the number of training samples $m$, the system is well-conditioned, which yields estimation and generalization guarantees. Detailed numerical experiments on benchmark PDE problems, including advection, Burgers', Darcy flow, Helmholtz, Navier-Stokes, and structural mechanics, demonstrate that RRFF and RRFF-FEM are robust to noise and achieve improved performance with reduced training time compared to the unregularized random feature model, while maintaining competitive accuracy relative to kernel and neural operator tests.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u968f\u673a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u6709\u9650\u5143\u91cd\u5efa\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53c8\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRRFF-FEM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u5143Student's t\u5206\u5e03\u62bd\u53d6\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9891\u7387\u52a0\u6743\u7684Tikhonov\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6291\u5236\u9ad8\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u5f53\u7279\u5f81\u6570N\u6309m log m\u7f29\u653e\u65f6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6761\u4ef6\u826f\u597d\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u77e9\u9635\u6781\u7aef\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u826f\u597d\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u3002\u5728\u591a\u4e2aPDE\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RRFF\u548cRRFF-FEM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u5b50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}
