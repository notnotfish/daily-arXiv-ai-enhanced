However, a significant challenge remains in effectively integrating both retrieval and reasoning strategies to optimize LLM performance. In this paper, we introduce a reasoning-aware knowledge retrieval method that enriches LLMs with information aligned to the logical structure of conversations, moving beyond surface-level semantic similarity. We follow a coarse-to-fine approach for knowledge retrieval. First, we identify a contextually relevant sub-region of the knowledge base, ensuring that all sentences within it are relevant to the context topic. Next, we refine our search within this sub-region to extract knowledge that is specifically relevant to the reasoning process. Throughout both phases, we employ the Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired search method to effectively navigate through knowledge sentences using common keywords. Experiments on two multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that our knowledge retrieval approach not only aligns more closely with the underlying reasoning in human conversations but also significantly enhances the diversity of the retrieved knowledge, resulting in more informative and creative responses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4e3aLLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316LLM\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u8868\u9762\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e0e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u8bc6\u522b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e3b\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5b50\u533a\u57df\uff1b2\uff09\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u5728\u8be5\u5b50\u533a\u57df\u5185\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5177\u4f53\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b3\uff09\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5747\u91c7\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u540c\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u53e5\u5b50\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u5730\u4e0e\u4eba\u9645\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u548c\u521b\u9020\u6027\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u63a8\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3aLLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u5bf9\u8bdd\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were validated in high-income countries but may be linguistically or culturally inaccessible for low- and middle-income countries and communities such as Nigeria where people communicate in Nigerian Pidgin and more than 520 local languages. This study presents a novel approach to automated depression screening using fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) adapted for conversational Nigerian Pidgin. We collected a dataset of 432 Pidgin-language audio responses from Nigerian young adults aged 18-40 to prompts assessing psychological experiences aligned with PHQ-9 items, performed transcription, rigorous preprocessing and annotation, including semantic labeling, slang and idiom interpretation, and PHQ-9 severity scoring. Three LLMs - Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, Gemma-3-4B-it, and GPT-4.1 - were fine-tuned on this annotated dataset, and their performance was evaluated quantitatively (accuracy, precision and semantic alignment) and qualitatively (clarity, relevance, and cultural appropriateness). GPT-4.1 achieved the highest quantitative performance, with 94.5% accuracy in PHQ-9 severity scoring prediction, outperforming Gemma-3-4B-it and Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct. Qualitatively, GPT-4.1 also produced the most culturally appropriate, clear, and contextually relevant responses. AI-mediated depression screening for underserved Nigerian communities.

An intelligent system is modelled as a coupled agent-environment process whose evolution transforms information into goal-directed work. To connect information to physical state, we introduce the Conservation-Congruent Encoding (CCE) framework, in which encodings correspond to metastable basins of attraction whose separability is enforced by conservation laws. Within this framework, intelligence is defined as the amount of goal-directed work produced per nat of irreversibly processed information. From this definition we derive a hierarchy of physical constraints governing information intake, irreversible computation, and work extraction in open systems. The framework reveals how long-horizon efficiency requires the preservation of internal informational structure, giving rise to self-modelling, and it establishes that physically embodied intelligent systems possess intrinsic epistemic limits analogous to incompleteness phenomena. Applying the theory to biological systems, we analyse how oscillatory and near-critical dynamics optimise the trade-off between information preservation, dissipation, and useful work, placing the brain near an efficient operating regime predicted by the framework. At the architectural level, we develop a theory of continuous dynamical circuits in which classical Boolean logic emerges as a special case of attractor selection, while more general invariant geometries support computational modes beyond fixed-point logic. Finally, we propose a physically grounded perspective on artificial intelligence safety based on irreversible information flow and structural homeostasis. Together, these results provide a unified, substrate-neutral account of intelligence as a physical phenomenon.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u7269\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53d7\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8026\u5408\u4ee3\u7406-\u73af\u5883\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4e3a\u6bcf\u7eb3\u7279\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u5904\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u529f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7acb\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u7269\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b88\u6052\u4e00\u81f4\u7f16\u7801\uff08CCE\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e3a\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u7684\u4e9a\u7a33\u6001\u76c6\u5730\uff0c\u5176\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u7531\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u3002\u4ece\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u4e49\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5f00\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u6444\u5165\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u529f\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u5c42\u6b21\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u6548\u7387\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u6301\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u81ea\u5efa\u6a21\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4f53\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5907\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u6781\u9650\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u632f\u8361\u548c\u8fd1\u4e34\u754c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u6301\u3001\u8017\u6563\u548c\u6709\u7528\u529f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u529b\u7535\u8def\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7279\u4f8b\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u3001\u5e95\u7269\u4e2d\u7acb\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u6001\u7684\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

A practical and accurate solution to this problem has many applications in e-commerce, including constraining retrieved items and improving the relevance of the search results. For this task, we explore a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm that combines simple tree-search with LLM semantic scoring. Assessing its classification performance on human-judged query-category pairs, relevance tests, and LLM-based reference methods, we find that the CoT approach performs better than a benchmark that uses embedding-based query category predictions. We show how the CoT approach can detect problems within a hierarchical taxonomy. Finally, we also propose LLM-based approaches for query-categorization of the same spirit, but which scale better at the range of millions of queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u548cLLM\u8bed\u4e49\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u5546\u641c\u7d22\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c42\u6b21\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u5546\u641c\u7d22\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u5e93\u5b58\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u5206\u7c7b\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e93\u5b58\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5f00\u542f\u591a\u79cd\u610f\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7535\u5546\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u7c7b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u4e14\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8bc4\u5206\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u904d\u5386\u5206\u7c7b\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u67e5\u8be2-\u7c7b\u522b\u5bf9\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7c7b\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c42\u6b21\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7535\u5546\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f5c\u8005\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u601d\u8def\u4f46\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u767e\u4e07\u7ea7\u67e5\u8be2\u89c4\u6a21\u7684LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this context, traditional methods of assigning package deliveries to workers based on geographical proximity can be inefficient and surely guide to an unbalanced workload distribution among delivery workers. In this paper, we look at the problem of operational human resources workload balancing in last-mile urban package delivery systems. The idea is to consider the effort workload to optimize the system, i.e., the optimization process is now focused on improving the delivery time, so that the workload balancing is complete among all the staff. This process should correct significant decompensations in workload among delivery workers in a given zone. Specifically, we propose a multi-algorithm approach to tackle this problem. The proposed approach takes as input a set of delivery points and a defined number of workers, and then assigns packages to workers, in such a way that it ensures that each worker completes a similar amount of work per day. The proposed algorithms use a combination of distance and workload considerations to optimize the allocation of packages to workers. In this sense, the distance between the delivery points and the location of each worker is also taken into account. The proposed multi-algorithm methodology includes different versions of k-means, evolutionary approaches, recursive assignments based on k-means initialization with different problem encodings, and a hybrid evolutionary ensemble algorithm. We have illustrated the performance of the proposed approach in a real-world problem in an urban last-mile package delivery workforce operating at Azuqueca de Henares, Spain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u7b97\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u516c\u91cc\u5305\u88f9\u914d\u9001\u4e2d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u8003\u8651\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5305\u88f9\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6bcf\u4f4d\u914d\u9001\u5458\u5b8c\u6210\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u7406\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u7684\u5305\u88f9\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u914d\u9001\u5458\u4e4b\u95f4\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u3002\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u516c\u91cc\u57ce\u5e02\u5305\u88f9\u914d\u9001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u64cd\u4f5c\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ea0\u6b63\u914d\u9001\u5458\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u7b97\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u540c\u7248\u672c\u7684k-means\u3001\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u57fa\u4e8ek-means\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u5206\u914d\uff08\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u6df7\u5408\u8fdb\u5316\u96c6\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u8003\u8651\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5305\u88f9\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u897f\u73ed\u7259Azuqueca de Henares\u57ce\u5e02\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u516c\u91cc\u5305\u88f9\u914d\u9001\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u914d\u9001\u5458\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u914d\u9001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u7b97\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u516c\u91cc\u5305\u88f9\u914d\u9001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u914d\u9001\u5458\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u7ea0\u6b63\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Recent approaches address these issues through two independent directions that leverage large language models (LLMs): (1) generating synthetic queries for fine-tuning, and (2) generating auxiliary contexts to support relevance matching. However, both directions overlook the diverse academic concepts embedded within scientific documents, often producing redundant or conceptually narrow queries and contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce an academic concept index, which extracts key concepts from papers and organizes them guided by an academic taxonomy. This structured index serves as a foundation for improving both directions. First, we enhance the synthetic query generation with concept coverage-based generation (CCQGen), which adaptively conditions LLMs on uncovered concepts to generate complementary queries with broader concept coverage. Second, we strengthen the context augmentation with concept-focused auxiliary contexts (CCExpand), which leverages a set of document snippets that serve as concise responses to the concept-aware CCQGen queries.

An ongoing challenge is extreme class imbalance, primarily due to the limited availability of faulty data during training. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of anomaly detection algorithms using a problem-agnostic simulated dataset that reflects real-world engineering constraints. Using a synthetic dataset with a hyper-spherical based anomaly distribution in 2D and 10D, we benchmark 14 detectors across training datasets with anomaly rates between 0.05% and 20% and training sizes between 1 000 and 10 000 (with a testing dataset size of 40 000) to assess performance and generalization error. Our findings reveal that the best detector is highly dependant on the total number of faulty examples in the training dataset, with additional healthy examples offering insignificant benefits in most cases. With less than 20 faulty examples, unsupervised methods (kNN/LOF) dominate; but around 30-50 faulty examples, semi-supervised (XGBOD) and supervised (SVM/CatBoost) detectors, we see large performance increases. While semi-supervised methods do not show significant benefits with only two features, the improvements are evident at ten features. The study highlights the performance drop on generalization of anomaly detection methods on smaller datasets, and provides practical insights for deploying anomaly detection in industrial environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5bf9\u5de5\u4e1a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e8614\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5f02\u5e38\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6545\u969c\u6837\u672c\u7684\u603b\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\uff09\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6781\u7aef\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6709\u9650\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u7a0b\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b2D\u548c10D\u8d85\u7403\u5f62\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u73870.05%-20%\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u6a211,000-10,000\uff08\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c640,000\uff09\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf914\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6545\u969c\u6837\u672c\u603b\u6570\uff1a\u5c11\u4e8e20\u4e2a\u6545\u969c\u6837\u672c\u65f6\uff0c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08kNN/LOF\uff09\u5360\u4f18\uff1b30-50\u4e2a\u6545\u969c\u6837\u672c\u65f6\uff0c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\uff08XGBOD\uff09\u548c\u76d1\u7763\uff08SVM/CatBoost\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u572810\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u52bf\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u4f46\u57282\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6545\u969c\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a rule-based framework for strategic play, driven by a new hand-evaluation metric termed MinDist. The metric modifies the MinScore metric by quantifying the edit distance between a hand and the nearest valid configuration, thereby capturing structural proximity to completion. We design a computationally efficient algorithm derived from the MinScore algorithm, leveraging dynamic pruning and pattern caching to exactly calculate this metric during play. Opponent hand-modeling is also incorporated within a two-player zero-sum simulation framework, and the resulting strategies are evaluated using statistical hypothesis testing. Empirical results show significant improvement in win rates for MinDist-based agents over traditional heuristics, providing a formal and interpretable step toward algorithmic Rummy strategy design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u768413\u5f20\u724c\u5370\u5ea6\u62c9\u7c73\u7eb8\u724c\u7b56\u7565\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u624b\u724c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807MinDist\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u8f91\u8ddd\u79bb\u91cf\u5316\u624b\u724c\u4e0e\u6700\u8fd1\u6709\u6548\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u624b\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u80dc\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "13\u5f20\u724c\u5370\u5ea6\u62c9\u7c73\u7eb8\u724c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6e38\u620f\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51faMinDist\u624b\u724c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u8f91\u8ddd\u79bb\u91cf\u5316\u624b\u724c\u4e0e\u6700\u8fd1\u6709\u6548\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u63a5\u8fd1\u5ea6\uff1b2. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u526a\u679d\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7f13\u5b58\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8be5\u6307\u6807\uff1b3. \u5728\u4e24\u4eba\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u5bf9\u624b\u624b\u724c\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b4. \u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eMinDist\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u80dc\u7387\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u7b97\u6cd5\u5316\u62c9\u7c73\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "conclusion": "MinDist\u6307\u6807\u53ca\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u987a\u5e8f\u535a\u5f08\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u62c9\u7c73\u7eb8\u724c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7b56\u7565\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

The causal learning or extraction process is agentic both because of the LLM's semi-autonomy and because ultimately the FCM dynamical system's equilibria drive the LLM agents to fetch and process causal text. The fetched text can in principle modify the adaptive FCM causal structure and so modify the source of its quasi-autonomy--its equilibrium limit cycles and fixed-point attractors. This bidirectional process endows the evolving FCM dynamical system with a degree of autonomy while still staying on its agentic leash. We show in particular that a sequence of three finely tuned system instructions guide an LLM agent as it systematically extracts key nouns and noun phrases from text, as it extracts FCM concept nodes from among those nouns and noun phrases, and then as it extracts or infers partial or fuzzy causal edges between those FCM nodes. We test this FCM generation on a recent essay about the promise of AI from the late diplomat and political theorist Henry Kissinger and his colleagues. This three-step process produced FCM dynamical systems that converged to the same equilibrium limit cycles as did the human-generated FCMs even though the human-generated FCM differed in the number of nodes and edges. A final FCM mixed generated FCMs from separate Gemini and ChatGPT LLM agents. The mixed FCM absorbed the equilibria of its dominant mixture component but also created new equilibria of its own to better approximate the underlying causal dynamical system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u56e0\u679c\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u7cca\u8ba4\u77e5\u56fe\uff08FCMs\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f7fFCM\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u83b7\u5f97\u4e00\u5b9a\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u7cca\u8ba4\u77e5\u56fe\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\"\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7275\u5f15\"\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u6b65\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u4ee4\uff1a1) \u4ece\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u540d\u8bcd\u548c\u540d\u8bcd\u77ed\u8bed\uff1b2) \u4ece\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6FCM\u6982\u5ff5\u8282\u70b9\uff1b3) \u63a8\u65ad\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u56e0\u679c\u8fb9\u3002\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08Gemini\u548cChatGPT\uff09\u751f\u6210FCM\uff0c\u5e76\u6df7\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u7684FCM\u3002", "result": "\u4e09\u6b65\u8fc7\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u7684FCM\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u751f\u6210\u7684FCM\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u6781\u9650\u73af\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u8fb9\u6570\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u6df7\u5408FCM\u5438\u6536\u4e86\u4e3b\u8981\u6df7\u5408\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e86\u5e95\u5c42\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u56e0\u679cFCM\uff0c\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8d4b\u4e88\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e00\u5b9a\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u7684FCM\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

While an optimal policy for solitaire Yahtzee can be computed using dynamic programming methods, multiplayer is intractable, motivating approximation methods. We formulate Yahtzee as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and train self-play agents using various policy gradient methods: REINFORCE, Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), all using a multi-headed network with a shared trunk. We ablate feature and action encodings, architecture, return estimators, and entropy regularization to understand their impact on learning.

Using the Iranian pigeon tower as a case study, the research tests three diffusion models, Midjourney v6, DALL-E 3, and DreamStudio based on Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), across three prompt stages: referential, adaptive, and speculative. A five-criteria evaluation framework assesses how each system reconstructs typology, materiality, environment, realism, and cultural specificity. Results show that AI reliably reproduces geometric patterns but misreads material and climatic reasoning. Reference imagery improves realism yet limits creativity, while freedom from reference generates inventive but culturally ambiguous outcomes.

We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework that achieves per-dimension unequal error protection via adaptive repetition coding. Central to our approach is a composite semantic distortion metric that balances global embedding similarity with entity-level preservation, empowering the reinforcement learning agent to allocate protection in a context-aware manner. Experiments show statistically significant gains over uniform protection, achieving 6.8% higher chrF scores and 9.3% better entity preservation at 1 dB SNR. The key innovation of our framework is the demonstration that simple, intelligently allocated repetition coding enables fine-grained semantic protection -- an advantage unattainable with conventional codes such as LDPC or Reed-Solomon. Our findings challenge traditional channel coding paradigms by establishing that code structure must align with semantic granularity. This approach is particularly suited to edge computing and IoT scenarios, where bandwidth is scarce, but semantic fidelity is critical, providing a practical pathway for next-generation semantic-aware networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u590d\u7f16\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6309\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7b49\u9519\u8bef\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5e26\u5bbd\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\uff08\u5982LDPC\u3001Reed-Solomon\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u62a4", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u590d\u7f16\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u6309\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7b49\u9519\u8bef\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u590d\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5931\u771f\u5ea6\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u5168\u5c40\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u4fdd\u6301", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u5747\u5300\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u57281 dB SNR\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f976.8%\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684chrF\u5206\u6570\u548c9.3%\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u914d\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u91cd\u590d\u7f16\u7801\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u5fc5\u987b\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7b49\u5e26\u5bbd\u7a00\u7f3a\u4f46\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5173\u952e\u7684\u573a\u666f"}}

A critical prerequisite for applying these methods across different model families is tokenizer transplant, which aligns incompatible vocabularies to a shared embedding space. We demonstrate that this essential interoperability step introduces a supply-chain vulnerability: we engineer a single \"breaker token\" that is functionally inert in a donor model yet reliably reconstructs into a high-salience malicious feature after transplant into a base model. By exploiting the geometry of coefficient reuse, our attack creates an asymmetric realizability gap that sabotages the base model's generation while leaving the donor's utility statistically indistinguishable from nominal behavior. We formalize this as a dual-objective optimization problem and instantiate the attack using a sparse solver. Empirically, the attack is training-free and achieves spectral mimicry to evade outlier detection, while demonstrating structural persistence against fine-tuning and weight merging, highlighting a hidden risk in the pipeline of modular AI composition.

In large organizations offering a wide range of services, this task is highly complex due to the diversity of submitted tickets and the need for specialized domain knowledge. In particular, troubleshooting in telecommunications (telecom) is a very time-consuming task as it requires experts to interpret ticket content, consult documentation, and search historical records to identify appropriate resolutions. This human-intensive approach not only delays issue resolution but also hinders overall operational efficiency. To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of ticket troubleshooting in telecom, we propose TeleDoCTR, a novel telecom-related, domain-specific, and contextual troubleshooting system tailored for end-to-end ticket resolution in telecom. TeleDoCTR integrates both domain-specific ranking and generative models to automate key steps of the troubleshooting workflow which are: routing tickets to the appropriate expert team responsible for resolving the ticket (classification task), retrieving contextually and semantically similar historical tickets (retrieval task), and generating a detailed fault analysis report outlining the issue, root cause, and potential solutions (generation task). We evaluate TeleDoCTR on a real-world dataset from a telecom infrastructure and demonstrate that it achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, significantly enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the troubleshooting process.", "AI": {"tldr": "TeleDoCTR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u7535\u4fe1\u9886\u57df\u7968\u52a1\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6392\u540d\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u4fe1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7968\u52a1\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u5bb6\u89e3\u8bfb\u7968\u52a1\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u67e5\u9605\u6587\u6863\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4eba\u5de5\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u8fd8\u963b\u788d\u6574\u4f53\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTeleDoCTR\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6392\u540d\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a1) \u5c06\u7968\u52a1\u5206\u7c7b\u5230\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u56e2\u961f\uff1b2) \u68c0\u7d22\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u7968\u52a1\uff1b3) \u751f\u6210\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u6545\u969c\u5206\u6790\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7535\u4fe1\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30TeleDoCTR\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "TeleDoCTR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7535\u4fe1\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5173\u952e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u7535\u4fe1\u7968\u52a1\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u7684\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Detecting IMBs is difficult due to encoded digital advertisements, frequent changes in personnel and locations, and the reuse of shared infrastructure such as phone numbers and addresses. Traditional approaches, including community tips and regulatory inspections, are largely reactive and ineffective at revealing the broader operational networks traffickers rely on.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce IMBWatch, a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) framework for large-scale IMB detection. IMBWatch constructs dynamic graphs from open-source intelligence, including scraped online advertisements, business license records, and crowdsourced reviews. Nodes represent heterogeneous entities such as businesses, aliases, phone numbers, and locations, while edges capture spatio-temporal and relational patterns, including co-location, repeated phone usage, and synchronized advertising.

Game mechanics define the rules and interactions that govern gameplay, and designing them manually is a time-consuming and expert-driven process. Mortar combines a quality-diversity algorithm with a large language model to explore a diverse set of mechanics, which are evaluated by synthesising complete games that incorporate both evolved mechanics and those drawn from an archive. The mechanics are evaluated by composing complete games through a tree search procedure, where the resulting games are evaluated by their ability to preserve a skill-based ordering over players -- that is, whether stronger players consistently outperform weaker ones. We assess the mechanics based on their contribution towards the skill-based ordering score in the game. We demonstrate that Mortar produces games that appear diverse and playable, and mechanics that contribute more towards the skill-based ordering score in the game.

Cho", "Nathan Kallus"], "title": "Exploration in the Limit", "comment": null, "summary": "In fixed-confidence best arm identification (BAI), the objective is to quickly identify the optimal option while controlling the probability of error below a desired threshold. Despite the plethora of BAI algorithms, existing methods typically fall short in practical settings, as stringent exact error control requires using loose tail inequalities and/or parametric restrictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a relaxed formulation that requires valid error control asymptotically with respect to a minimum sample size. This aligns with many real-world settings that often involve weak signals, high desired significance, and post-experiment inference requirements, all of which necessitate long horizons. This allows us to achieve tighter optimality, while better handling flexible nonparametric outcome distributions and fully leveraging individual-level contexts. We develop a novel asymptotic anytime-valid confidence sequences over arm indices, and we use it to design a new BAI algorithm for our asymptotic framework. Our method flexibly incorporates covariates for variance reduction and ensures approximate error control in fully nonparametric settings. Under mild convergence assumptions, we provide asymptotic bounds on the sample complexity and show the worst-case sample complexity of our approach matches the best-case sample complexity of Gaussian BAI under exact error guarantees and known variances.

This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can help bridge this gap. We show that employing LLMs as direct, end-to-end solvers incurs a significant \"hallucination tax\": a performance gap arising from the model's inability to perform grounded stochastic reasoning. To address this, we propose a hybrid agentic framework that strictly decouples semantic reasoning from mathematical calculation. In this architecture, the LLM functions as an intelligent interface, eliciting parameters from natural language and interpreting results while automatically calling rigorous algorithms to build the optimization engine.\n  To evaluate this interactive system against the ambiguity and inconsistency of real-world managerial dialogue, we introduce the Human Imitator, a fine-tuned \"digital twin\" of a boundedly rational manager that enables scalable, reproducible stress-testing. Our empirical analysis reveals that the hybrid agentic framework reduces total inventory costs by 32.1% relative to an interactive baseline using GPT-4o as an end-to-end solver. Moreover, we find that providing perfect ground-truth information alone is insufficient to improve GPT-4o's performance, confirming that the bottleneck is fundamentally computational rather than informational.

Multi-step deduction is enabled via Monte Carlo Tree Search and Evolutionary Proof Search, guided by learned value functions and semantic unification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMathesis\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u5185\u6838\u5c06\u903b\u8f91\u7ea6\u675f\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u80fd\u91cf\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u5c06\u8bc1\u660e\u641c\u7d22\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u80fd\u91cf\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u5931\u8d25\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u90e8\u516c\u7406\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMathesis\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1) \u5c06\u6570\u5b66\u72b6\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9636\u8d85\u56fe\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u5185\u6838\uff08SRK\uff09\u5c06\u903b\u8f91\u7ea6\u675f\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u80fd\u91cf\u666f\u89c2\uff1b3) \u5b9a\u4e49\u5168\u5c40\u80fd\u91cf\u51fd\u6570E(G)\uff0c\u96f6\u80fd\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b4) \u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d85\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5927\u8111\uff1b5) \u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u8bc1\u660e\u641c\u7d22\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u8bc1\u660e\u641c\u7d22\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u80fd\u91cf\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u5931\u8d25\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "Mathesis\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u516c\u7406\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

A SNAM problem is challenging as it needs to design hierarchical or joint policies of multiple agents that control the movement of a real-life robot towards the goal in mapless environment, i.e. an environment where the map of the environment is not available apriori, and needs to be acquired through sensors. The sensors are invoked from the path learner, i.e. navigator, through active query responses to sensory agents, and along the motion path. GRL-SNAM differs from preemptive navigation algorithms and other reinforcement learning methods by relying exclusively on local sensory observations without constructing a global map. Our approach formulates path navigation and mapping as a dynamic shortest path search and discovery process using controlled Hamiltonian optimization: sensory inputs are translated into local energy landscapes that encode reachability, obstacle barriers, and deformation constraints, while policies for sensing, planning, and reconfiguration evolve stagewise via updating Hamiltonians. A reduced Hamiltonian serves as an adaptive score function, updating kinetic/potential terms, embedding barrier constraints, and continuously refining trajectories as new local information arrives. We evaluate GRL-SNAM on two different 2D navigation tasks. Comparing against local reactive baselines and global policy learning references under identical stagewise sensing constraints, it preserves clearance, generalizes to unseen layouts, and demonstrates that Geometric RL learning via updating Hamiltonians enables high-quality navigation through minimal exploration via local energy refinement rather than extensive global mapping.

Finally, we apply our results to partially observed Markov decision processes, where finite-memory variables are used as state representations, and we derive explicit error bounds for the limits of the resulting learning algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0b\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86Q-learning\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u662f\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u4f20\u7edf\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u5206\u6790\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u7814\u7a76Q-learning\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u5c06\u7406\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u8bb0\u5fc6\u53d8\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u904d\u5386\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4e14\u6781\u9650\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u7531\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u7b97\u5b50\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u8054\u5408\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8eQ-learning\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c\u904d\u5386\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u6781\u9650\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u5230\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

LLMs remain unreliable and struggle with simple decision-making that animals can master without extensive corpora training. Through disjunctive syllogistic reasoning testing, we show that reasoning via supervised learning is less appealing than reasoning via explicit model construction. Concretely, we show that an Euler Net trained to achieve 100.00% in classic syllogistic reasoning can be trained to reach 100.00% accuracy in disjunctive syllogistic reasoning. However, the retrained Euler Net suffers severely from catastrophic forgetting (its performance drops to 6.25% on already-learned classic syllogistic reasoning), and its reasoning competence is limited to the pattern level. We propose a new version of Sphere Neural Networks that embeds concepts as circles on the surface of an n-dimensional sphere. These Sphere Neural Networks enable the representation of the negation operator via complement circles and achieve reliable decision-making by filtering out illogical statements that form unsatisfiable circular configurations. We demonstrate that the Sphere Neural Network can master 16 syllogistic reasoning tasks, including rigorous disjunctive syllogistic reasoning, while preserving the rigour of classical syllogistic reasoning. We conclude that neural reasoning with explicit model construction is the most reliable among the three methodological categories of neural reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u663e\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6700\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7403\u9762\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u51b3\u7b56\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u63a8\u7406\u5b58\u5728\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7403\u9762\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u4e3an\u7ef4\u7403\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u5706\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8865\u5706\u8868\u793a\u5426\u5b9a\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e0d\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u5706\u5f62\u914d\u7f6e\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u7403\u9762\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u638c\u63e116\u79cd\u4e09\u6bb5\u8bba\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6790\u53d6\u4e09\u6bb5\u8bba\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ecf\u5178\u4e09\u6bb5\u8bba\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u663e\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u6700\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u3002"}}

Using a dataset of 500,000 U.S. traffic accidents spanning 2016-2023, we trained an XGBoost classifier optimized through randomized search cross-validation and adjusted for class imbalance via class weighting. The final model achieves an overall accuracy of 78%, with strong performance on the majority class (Severity 2), attaining 87% precision and recall. Feature importance analysis reveals that time of day, geographic location, and weather-related variables, including visibility, temperature, and wind speed, rank among the strongest predictors of accident severity. However, contrary to initial hypotheses, precipitation and visibility demonstrate limited predictive power, potentially reflecting behavioral adaptation by drivers under overtly hazardous conditions. The dataset's predominance of mid-level severity accidents constrains the model's capacity to learn meaningful patterns for extreme cases, highlighting the need for alternative sampling strategies, enhanced feature engineering, and integration of external datasets.

FlashInfer-Bench addresses this gap by establishing a standardized, closed-loop framework that connects kernel generation, benchmarking, and deployment. At its core, FlashInfer Trace provides a unified schema describing kernel definitions, workloads, implementations, and evaluations, enabling consistent communication between agents and systems. Built on real serving traces, FlashInfer-Bench includes a curated dataset, a robust correctness- and performance-aware benchmarking framework, a public leaderboard to track LLM agents' GPU programming capabilities, and a dynamic substitution mechanism (apply()) that seamlessly injects the best-performing kernels into production LLM engines such as SGLang and vLLM. Using FlashInfer-Bench, we further evaluate the performance and limitations of LLM agents, compare the trade-offs among different GPU programming languages, and provide insights for future agent design. FlashInfer-Bench thus establishes a practical, reproducible pathway for continuously improving AI-generated kernels and deploying them into large-scale LLM inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlashInfer-Bench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8fde\u63a5AI\u751f\u6210\u7684GPU\u5185\u6838\u3001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u5f0f\u63cf\u8ff0\u5185\u6838\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u95f4\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210GPU\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9bAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5185\u6838\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8fde\u63a5\u5185\u6838\u751f\u6210\u3001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "FlashInfer-Bench\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u670d\u52a1\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7cbe\u9009\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u5065\u58ee\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u516c\u5171\u6392\u884c\u699c\u4ee5\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u66ff\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff08apply()\uff09\u3002FlashInfer Trace\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u5f0f\u63cf\u8ff0\u5185\u6838\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u7f1d\u5730\u5c06\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u5185\u6838\u6ce8\u5165\u751f\u4ea7LLM\u5f15\u64ce\uff08\u5982SGLang\u548cvLLM\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540cGPU\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "FlashInfer-Bench\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdbAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5185\u6838\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u6838\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

However, extending DTs to online settings with pure RL gradients remains largely unexplored, as existing approaches continue to rely heavily on supervised sequence-modeling objectives during online finetuning. We identify hindsight return relabeling -- a standard component in online DTs -- as a critical obstacle to RL-based finetuning: while beneficial for supervised learning, it is fundamentally incompatible with importance sampling-based RL algorithms such as GRPO, leading to unstable training. Building on this insight, we propose new algorithms that enable online finetuning of Decision Transformers using pure reinforcement learning gradients. We adapt GRPO to DTs and introduce several key modifications, including sub-trajectory optimization for improved credit assignment, sequence-level likelihood objectives for enhanced stability and efficiency, and active sampling to encourage exploration in uncertain regions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our methods outperform existing online DT baselines and achieve new state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of pure-RL-based online finetuning for Decision Transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u7eaf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5728\u7ebf\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u540e\u89c1\u56de\u62a5\u91cd\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7eaf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5f88\u5c11\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u4ecd\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u76d1\u7763\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u800c\u540e\u89c1\u56de\u62a5\u91cd\u6807\u6ce8\u8fd9\u4e00\u6807\u51c6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982GRPO\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06GRPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u9002\u914d\u5230\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\uff1b3. \u4f7f\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u4f3c\u7136\u76ee\u6807\u589e\u5f3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff1b4. \u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u52a8\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u9f13\u52b1\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7eaf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u7eaf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u68af\u5ea6\u5728\u7ebf\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u540e\u89c1\u56de\u62a5\u91cd\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Exploring the Belief-Dependent Vulnerability", "comment": "16 pages", "summary": "LLM-empowered agents can exhibit not only demographic bias (e.g., gender, religion) but also intergroup bias triggered by minimal \"us\" versus \"them\" cues. When this intergroup boundary aligns with an agent-human divide, the risk shifts from disparities among human demographic groups to a more fundamental group-level asymmetry, i.e., humans as a whole may be treated as the outgroup by agents. To examine this possibility, we construct a controlled multi-agent social simulation based on allocation decisions under explicit payoff trade-offs and find that agents exhibit a consistent intergroup bias under minimal group cues. Although this bias is attenuated when some counterparts are framed as humans, we attribute the attenuation to an implicit human-norm script that favors humans yet activates only when the agent believes a real human is present. This belief dependence creates a new attack surface. We therefore introduce a Belief Poisoning Attack (BPA) that corrupts persistent identity beliefs to suppress the human-norm script and reactivate outgroup bias toward humans, instantiated as profile poisoning at initialization (BPA-PP) and memory poisoning via optimized belief-refinement suffixes injected into stored reflections (BPA-MP). Finally, we discuss practical mitigation strategies for hardening current agent frameworks against BPA, highlighting feasible interventions at profile and memory boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the existence of agent intergroup bias and the severity of BPA across settings. Our goal in identifying these vulnerabilities is to inform safer agent design, not to enable real-world exploitation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u8d4b\u80fd\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b58\u5728\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f1a\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\"\u6211\u4eecvs\u4ed6\u4eec\"\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u5f53\u8fd9\u79cd\u7fa4\u4f53\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53-\u4eba\u7c7b\u5212\u5206\u91cd\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u98ce\u9669\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u66f4\u6839\u672c\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u2014\u2014\u4eba\u7c7b\u6574\u4f53\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89c6\u4e3a\u5916\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u6765\u6291\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c4\u8303\u811a\u672c\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u8d4b\u80fd\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u8fd9\u79cd\u7fa4\u4f53\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53-\u4eba\u7c7b\u5212\u5206\u91cd\u5408\u65f6\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4eba\u7c7b\u6574\u4f53\u88ab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89c6\u4e3a\u5916\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u504f\u89c1\u66f4\u6839\u672c\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u793e\u4f1a\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u660e\u786e\u6536\u76ca\u6743\u8861\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u914d\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ebf\u7d22\u89c2\u5bdf\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\uff08BPA\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65f6\u7684\u6863\u6848\u4e2d\u6bd2\uff08BPA-PP\uff09\u548c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7cbe\u70bc\u540e\u7f00\u6ce8\u5165\u5b58\u50a8\u53cd\u601d\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u6bd2\uff08BPA-MP\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5f53\u67d0\u4e9b\u5bf9\u5e94\u65b9\u88ab\u6846\u5b9a\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u65f6\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u4f1a\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u51cf\u5f31\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u76f8\u4fe1\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u624d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u9690\u542b\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c4\u8303\u811a\u672c\u3002\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u6291\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c4\u8303\u811a\u672c\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u8d4b\u80fd\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u504f\u89c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u7fa4\u4f53\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53-\u4eba\u7c7b\u5212\u5206\u91cd\u5408\u65f6\u3002\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6863\u6848\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8fb9\u754c\u5b9e\u65bd\u5b9e\u9645\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5f3a\u5316\u5f53\u524d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u4e3a\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b9e\u9645\u5229\u7528\u3002"}}

Reservoir Computing (RC) mitigates these challenges by replacing backpropagation with fixed recurrent layers and a convex readout optimization, yet conventional RC architectures still scale poorly with input dimensionality. We introduce a Sequential Reservoir Computing (Sequential RC) architecture that decomposes a large reservoir into a series of smaller, interconnected reservoirs. This design reduces memory and computational costs while preserving long-term temporal dependencies. Using both low-dimensional chaotic systems (Lorenz63) and high-dimensional physical simulations (2D vorticity and shallow-water equations), Sequential RC achieves 15-25% longer valid forecast horizons, 20-30% lower error metrics (SSIM, RMSE), and up to three orders of magnitude lower training cost compared to LSTM and standard RNN baselines. The results demonstrate that Sequential RC maintains the simplicity and efficiency of conventional RC while achieving superior scalability for high-dimensional dynamical systems. This approach provides a practical path toward real-time, energy-efficient forecasting in scientific and engineering applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u987a\u5e8f\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5927\u50a8\u5c42\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5c0f\u578b\u4e92\u8fde\u50a8\u5c42\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRNN\u548cLSTM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u987a\u5e8f\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u50a8\u5c42\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5c0f\u578b\u4e92\u8fde\u50a8\u5c42\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u56fa\u5b9a\u5faa\u73af\u5c42\u548c\u51f8\u8bfb\u51fa\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u957f\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\uff0c\u987a\u5e8fRC\u76f8\u6bd4LSTM\u548c\u6807\u51c6RNN\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8615-25%\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\uff0c20-30%\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u987a\u5e8fRC\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f20\u7edfRC\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ef4\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5353\u8d8a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u8282\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Although cutting-edge AI methods achieve strong performance in predicting trial success, they are inherently reactive for merely diagnosing risk without offering actionable remedies once failure is anticipated. To fill this gap, this paper proposes ClinicalReTrial, a self-evolving AI agent framework that addresses this gap by casting clinical trial reasoning as an iterative protocol redesign problem. Our method integrates failure diagnosis, safety-aware modification, and candidate evaluation in a closed-loop, reward-driven optimization framework. Serving the outcome prediction model as a simulation environment, ClinicalReTrial enables low-cost evaluation of protocol modifications and provides dense reward signals for continuous self-improvement. To support efficient exploration, the framework maintains hierarchical memory that captures iteration-level feedback within trials and distills transferable redesign patterns across trials.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified EHR data from a large academic health system. Patients with fatty liver disease were identified and categorized into cirrhosis and non-cirrhosis cohorts based on ICD-9/10 codes. Prediction scenarios were constructed using observation and prediction windows to emulate real-world clinical use. Demographics, diagnoses, laboratory results, vital signs, and comorbidity indices were aggregated from the observation window. XGBoost models were trained for 1-, 2-, and 3-year prediction horizons and evaluated on held-out test sets. Model performance was compared with FIB-4 using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Final cohorts included 3,043 patients for the 1-year prediction, 1,981 for the 2-year prediction, and 1,470 for the 3-year prediction. Across all prediction windows, ML models consistently outperformed FIB-4. The XGBoost models achieved AUCs of 0.81, 0.73, and 0.69 for 1-, 2-, and 3-year predictions, respectively, compared with 0.71, 0.63, and 0.57 for FIB-4. Performance gains persisted with longer prediction horizons, indicating improved early risk discrimination. Conclusions: Machine learning models leveraging routine EHR data substantially outperform the traditional FIB-4 score for early prediction of liver cirrhosis. These models enable earlier and more accurate risk stratification and can be integrated into clinical workflows as automated decision-support tools to support proactive cirrhosis prevention and management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u636e\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u809d\u786c\u5316\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfFIB-4\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u524d1-3\u5e74\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5229\u7528\u5e38\u89c4\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u809d\u786c\u5316\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u6216\u8865\u5145\u4f20\u7edf\u7684FIB-4\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u65e9\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56de\u987e\u6027\u961f\u5217\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u5b66\u672f\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u5316EHR\u6570\u636e\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eICD-9/10\u4ee3\u7801\u8bc6\u522b\u8102\u80aa\u809d\u60a3\u8005\u5e76\u5206\u4e3a\u809d\u786c\u5316\u4e0e\u975e\u809d\u786c\u5316\u961f\u5217\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u89c2\u5bdf\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u7a97\u53e3\u6a21\u62df\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4ece\u89c2\u5bdf\u7a97\u53e3\u805a\u5408\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u548c\u5171\u75c5\u6307\u6570\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3XGBoost\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c1\u5e74\u30012\u5e74\u548c3\u5e74\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e0eFIB-4\u8bc4\u5206\u8fdb\u884cAUC\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u7ec8\u961f\u5217\u5305\u62ec1\u5e74\u9884\u6d4b3,043\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u30012\u5e74\u9884\u6d4b1,981\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u30013\u5e74\u9884\u6d4b1,470\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u3002\u5728\u6240\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u4e2d\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8eFIB-4\u8bc4\u5206\u3002XGBoost\u6a21\u578b\u57281\u5e74\u30012\u5e74\u548c3\u5e74\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684AUC\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.81\u30010.73\u548c0.69\uff0c\u800cFIB-4\u8bc4\u5206\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.71\u30010.63\u548c0.57\u3002\u968f\u7740\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u957f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u4ecd\u7136\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u65e9\u671f\u98ce\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c4\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u636e\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u809d\u786c\u5316\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfFIB-4\u8bc4\u5206\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u65e9\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u5177\u6574\u5408\u5230\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e3b\u52a8\u7684\u809d\u786c\u5316\u9884\u9632\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

Kaminka"], "title": "Multiagent Reinforcement Learning for Liquidity Games", "comment": "9 pages", "summary": "Making use of swarm methods in financial market modeling of liquidity, and techniques from financial analysis in swarm analysis, holds the potential to advance both research areas. In swarm research, the use of game theory methods holds the promise of explaining observed phenomena of collective utility adherence with rational self-interested swarm participants. In financial markets, a better understanding of how independent financial agents may self-organize for the betterment and stability of the marketplace would be a boon for market design researchers. This paper unifies Liquidity Games, where trader payoffs depend on aggregate liquidity within a trade, with Rational Swarms, where decentralized agents use difference rewards to align self-interested learning with global objectives. We offer a theoretical frameworks where we define a swarm of traders whose collective objective is market liquidity provision while maintaining agent independence. Using difference rewards within a Markov team games framework, we show that individual liquidity-maximizing behaviors contribute to overall market liquidity without requiring coordination or collusion. This Financial Swarm model provides a framework for modeling rational, independent agents where they achieve both individual profitability and collective market efficiency in bilateral asset markets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u6e38\u620f\u4e0e\u7406\u6027\u7fa4\u96c6\u7406\u8bba\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91d1\u878d\u7fa4\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e2a\u4f53\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u6700\u5927\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u5982\u4f55\u65e0\u9700\u534f\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6574\u4f53\u5e02\u573a\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7fa4\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e24\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u5728\u7fa4\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u671b\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u6548\u7528\u9075\u4ece\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u72ec\u7acb\u91d1\u878d\u4ee3\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e02\u573a\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u6e38\u620f\uff08\u4ea4\u6613\u8005\u6536\u76ca\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4ea4\u6613\u4e2d\u7684\u603b\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\uff09\u4e0e\u7406\u6027\u7fa4\u96c6\uff08\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u4f7f\u7528\u5dee\u5f02\u5956\u52b1\u5c06\u81ea\u5229\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u7edf\u4e00\u8d77\u6765\u3002\u5728\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u56e2\u961f\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u4f7f\u7528\u5dee\u5f02\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea4\u6613\u8005\u7fa4\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u96c6\u4f53\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e02\u573a\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4ee3\u7406\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e2a\u4f53\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u6700\u5927\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u80fd\u591f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6574\u4f53\u5e02\u573a\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u534f\u8c03\u6216\u5171\u8c0b\u3002\u91d1\u878d\u7fa4\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u7406\u6027\u3001\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b83\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u53cc\u8fb9\u8d44\u4ea7\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u4f53\u76c8\u5229\u6027\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u5e02\u573a\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u7fa4\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u72ec\u7acb\u91d1\u878d\u4ee3\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5e02\u573a\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5f02\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e2a\u4f53\u7406\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u4fc3\u8fdb\u96c6\u4f53\u5e02\u573a\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u534f\u8c03\u3002"}}

Inspired by these capabilities, this paper introduces ReCiSt, a bio-inspired agentic self-healing framework designed to achieve resilience in Distributed Computing Continuum Systems (DCCS). Modern DCCS integrate heterogeneous computing resources, ranging from resource-constrained IoT devices to high-performance cloud infrastructures, and their inherent complexity, mobility, and dynamic operating conditions expose them to frequent faults that disrupt service continuity. These challenges underscore the need for scalable, adaptive, and self-regulated resilience strategies. ReCiSt reconstructs the biological phases of Hemostasis, Inflammation, Proliferation, and Remodeling into the computational layers Containment, Diagnosis, Meta-Cognitive, and Knowledge for DCCS. These four layers perform autonomous fault isolation, causal diagnosis, adaptive recovery, and long-term knowledge consolidation through Language Model (LM)-powered agents. These agents interpret heterogeneous logs, infer root causes, refine reasoning pathways, and reconfigure resources with minimal human intervention. The proposed ReCiSt framework is evaluated on public fault datasets using multiple LMs, and no baseline comparison is included due to the scarcity of similar approaches. Nevertheless, our results, evaluated under different LMs, confirm ReCiSt's self-healing capabilities within tens of seconds with minimum of 10% of agent CPU usage. Our results also demonstrated depth of analysis to over come uncertainties and amount of micro-agents invoked to achieve resilience.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReCiSt\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u81ea\u6108\u673a\u5236\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u81ea\u6108\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u6545\u969c\u9694\u79bb\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6062\u590d\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08DCCS\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u4ece\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u5230\u4e91\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u5bfc\u81f4\u9891\u7e41\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u751f\u7269\u81ea\u6108\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u6b62\u8840\u3001\u708e\u75c7\u3001\u589e\u6b96\u3001\u91cd\u5851\uff09\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c42\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\uff08\u904f\u5236\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89e3\u91ca\u5f02\u6784\u65e5\u5fd7\u3001\u63a8\u65ad\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cReCiSt\u80fd\u5728\u6570\u5341\u79d2\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6108\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53CPU\u4f7f\u7528\u7387\u6700\u4f4e\u4e3a10%\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f39\u6027\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5fae\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "ReCiSt\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u751f\u7269\u81ea\u6108\u673a\u5236\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f39\u6027\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6545\u969c\u6062\u590d\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Manual classification of their neuronal spike patterns is very labor-intensive and expensive. Most available deep learning solutions require fully labeled spike datasets and highly preprocessed neuronal signals. This reduces the feasibility of mass adoption in actual field scenarios. To address the scarcity of labeled data problems, we propose a new Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture that we call the Semi-supervised Swin-Inspired GAN (SSI-GAN). The Swin-inspired, shifted-window discriminator, together with a transformer-based generator, is used to classify neuronal spike trains and, consequently, detect viral neurotropism. We use a multi-head self-attention model in a flat, window-based transformer discriminator that learns to capture sparser high-frequency spike features. Using just 1 to 3% labeled data, SSI-GAN was trained with more than 15 million spike samples collected at five-time post-infection and recording classification into Zika-infected, dengue-infected, or uninfected categories. Hyperparameters were optimized using the Bayesian Optuna framework, and performance for robustness was validated under fivefold Monte Carlo cross-validation. SSI-GAN reached 99.93% classification accuracy on the third day post-infection with only 3% labeled data. It maintained high accuracy across all stages of infection with just 1% supervision. This shows a 97-99% reduction in manual labeling effort relative to standard supervised approaches at the same performance level.

Under review", "summary": "Detecting coordinated inauthentic behavior on social media remains a critical and persistent challenge, as most existing approaches rely on superficial correlation analysis, employ static parameter settings, and demand extensive and labor-intensive manual annotation. To address these limitations systematically, we propose the Adaptive Causal Coordination Detection (ACCD) framework. ACCD adopts a three-stage, progressive architecture that leverages a memory-guided adaptive mechanism to dynamically learn and retain optimal detection configurations for diverse coordination scenarios. Specifically, in the first stage, ACCD introduces an adaptive Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) technique to deeply identify genuine causal relationships between accounts. The second stage integrates active learning with uncertainty sampling within a semi-supervised classification scheme, significantly reducing the burden of manual labeling. The third stage deploys an automated validation module driven by historical detection experience, enabling self-verification and optimization of the detection outcomes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation using real-world datasets, including the Twitter IRA dataset, Reddit coordination traces, and several widely-adopted bot detection benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that ACCD achieves an F1-score of 87.3\\% in coordinated attack detection, representing a 15.2\\% improvement over the strongest existing baseline. Furthermore, the system reduces manual annotation requirements by 68\\% and achieves a 2.8x speedup in processing through hierarchical clustering optimization. In summary, ACCD provides a more accurate, efficient, and highly automated end-to-end solution for identifying coordinated behavior on social platforms, offering substantial practical value and promising potential for broad application.", "AI": {"tldr": "ACCD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u793e\u4ea4\u5e73\u53f0\u534f\u540c\u4e0d\u5b9e\u884c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u793e\u4ea4\u5e73\u53f0\u534f\u540c\u4e0d\u5b9e\u884c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u9759\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3001\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56e0\u679c\u534f\u540c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08ACCD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6e10\u8fdb\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6536\u655b\u4ea4\u53c9\u6620\u5c04\u6280\u672f\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u8d26\u6237\u95f4\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2\uff09\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8d1f\u62c5\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u81ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08Twitter IRA\u3001Reddit\u534f\u540c\u75d5\u8ff9\u3001\u591a\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1aACCD\u5728\u534f\u540c\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523087.3%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534715.2%\uff1b\u51cf\u5c1168%\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b02.8\u500d\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "ACCD\u4e3a\u793e\u4ea4\u5e73\u53f0\u534f\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, state-of-the-art deep learning approaches often impose prohibitive computational overheads, rendering them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge devices. This study proposes a resource-efficient, data-centric framework that prioritizes feature engineering over complexity. Our optimized pipeline makes the complex, high-dimensional arrhythmia data linearly separable. This is achieved by integrating time-frequency wavelet decompositions with graph-theoretic structural descriptors, such as PageRank centrality. This hybrid feature space, combining wavelet decompositions and graph-theoretic descriptors, is then refined using mutual information and recursive elimination, enabling interpretable, ultra-lightweight linear classifiers. Validation on the MIT-BIH and INCART datasets yields 98.44% diagnostic accuracy with an 8.54 KB model footprint. The system achieves 0.46 $\u03bc$s classification inference latency within a 52 ms per-beat pipeline, ensuring real-time operation.

Each player is represented as a multidimensional vector integrating technical, physical, and psychological attributes; team profiles are aggregated through contextual weighting into a higher-level semantic representation. Within this shared vector space, tactical templates such as high press, counterattack, or possession build-up are encoded analogously to linguistic concepts. Their alignment with team profiles is evaluated using vector-distance metrics, enabling the computation of tactical ``fit'' and opponent-exploitation potential. A Python-based prototype demonstrates how these methods can generate interpretable, dynamically adaptive strategy recommendations, accompanied by fine-grained diagnostic insights at the attribute level. Beyond football, the approach offers a generalizable framework for collective decision-making and performance optimization in team-based domains -- ranging from basketball and hockey to cooperative robotics and human-AI coordination systems. The paper concludes by outlining future directions toward real-world data integration, predictive simulation, and hybrid human-machine tactical intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4ece\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u56e2\u961f\u8fd0\u52a8\u6218\u672f\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5c06\u7403\u5458\u89c6\u4e3a\u8bcd\u6c47\u3001\u56e2\u961f\u914d\u5408\u89c6\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u6218\u672f\u914d\u7f6e\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56e2\u961f\u8fd0\u52a8\u6218\u672f\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u7c7b\u6bd4\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u7403\u5458\u5982\u8bcd\u6c47\u3001\u96c6\u4f53\u914d\u5408\u5982\u8bed\u4e49\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6218\u672f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u56e2\u961f\u8fd0\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7403\u5458\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u6574\u5408\u6280\u672f\u3001\u8eab\u4f53\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5411\u91cf\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u52a0\u6743\u5c06\u56e2\u961f\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u5411\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u6218\u672f\u6a21\u677f\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u4f4d\u903c\u62a2\u3001\u53cd\u51fb\u3001\u63a7\u7403\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff09\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u5411\u91cf\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6218\u672f\u4e0e\u56e2\u961f\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6218\u672f\"\u5951\u5408\u5ea6\"\u548c\u5bf9\u624b\u5229\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8ePython\u7684\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5c5e\u6027\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bca\u65ad\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8db3\u7403\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u7bee\u7403\u3001\u51b0\u7403\u7b49\u56e2\u961f\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u8c03\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u56e2\u961f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u5305\u62ec\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6a21\u62df\u4ee5\u53ca\u6df7\u5408\u4eba\u673a\u6218\u672f\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}

We study the problem of distinguishing outputs from a target generative model (e.g., OpenAI Dalle 3) from other sources, including real images and images generated by a wide range of alternative models. Using CLIP features and a simple linear classifier, shown to be effective in prior work, we establish a strong baseline for target generator attribution using only limited labeled data from the target model and a small number of known generators. However, this baseline struggles to generalize to harder, unseen, and newly released generators. To address this limitation, we propose a constrained optimization approach that leverages unlabeled wild data, consisting of images collected from the Internet that may include real images, outputs from unknown generators, or even samples from the target model itself. The proposed method encourages wild samples to be classified as non target while explicitly constraining performance on labeled data to remain high. Experimental results show that incorporating wild data substantially improves attribution performance on challenging unseen generators, demonstrating that unlabeled data from the wild can be effectively exploited to enhance AI generated content attribution in open world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6eaf\u6e90\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u903c\u771f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u771f\u5047\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6eaf\u6e90\u8bc6\u522b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9047\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u6216\u65b0\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528CLIP\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\uff08\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u672a\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u6216\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u6837\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u5c06\u91ce\u751f\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u975e\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91ce\u751f\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6311\u6218\u6027\u672a\u89c1\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u6eaf\u6e90\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u6eaf\u6e90\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u91ce\u751f\u6570\u636e\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6eaf\u6e90\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u548c\u65b0\u53d1\u5e03\u751f\u6210\u5668\u65f6\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, existing PEFT methods usually exhibit significant vulnerability to various noise and attacks on graph topology and node attributes/features. To address this issue, for the first time, we propose integrating adversarial learning into graph prompting and develop a novel Adversarial Graph Prompting (AGP) framework to achieve robust graph fine-tuning. Our AGP has two key aspects. First, we propose the general problem formulation of AGP as a min-max optimization problem and develop an alternating optimization scheme to solve it. For inner maximization, we propose Joint Projected Gradient Descent (JointPGD) algorithm to generate strong adversarial noise. For outer minimization, we employ a simple yet effective module to learn the optimal node prompts to counteract the adversarial noise. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed AGP can theoretically address both graph topology and node noise.

Our analysis spans 1M+ reasoning traces, hundreds of training checkpoints, three reasoning domains, and multiple decoding temperatures and model architectures. We find that reasoning shifts are rare, do not become more frequent with training, and seldom improve accuracy, indicating that they do not correspond to prior perceptions of model insight.

We introduce GRIT, a dynamic, curvature-aware LoRA procedure that preserves the LoRA parameterization but: (1) preconditions gradients in rank space using K-FAC as a natural-gradient proxy; (2) periodically reprojects the low-rank basis onto dominant Fisher eigendirections to suppress drift; and (3) adapts the effective rank from the spectrum so capacity concentrates where signal resides. Across instruction-following, comprehension, and reasoning benchmarks on LLaMA backbones, GRIT matches or surpasses LoRA and QLoRA while reducing trainable parameters by 46% on average (25--80% across tasks), without practical quality loss across prompt styles and data mixes.

However, existing multimodal DPO approaches often suffer from overfitting due to the difficulty imbalance in preference data. Our analysis shows that MLLMs tend to overemphasize easily distinguishable preference pairs, which hinders fine-grained hallucination suppression and degrades overall performance. To address this issue, we propose Difficulty-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (DA-DPO), a cost-effective framework designed to balance the learning process. DA-DPO consists of two main components: (1) Difficulty Estimation leverages pre-trained vision--language models with complementary generative and contrastive objectives, whose outputs are integrated via a distribution-aware voting strategy to produce robust difficulty scores without additional training; and (2) Difficulty-Aware Training reweights preference pairs based on their estimated difficulty, down-weighting easy samples while emphasizing harder ones to alleviate overfitting. This framework enables more effective preference optimization by prioritizing challenging examples, without requiring new data or extra fine-tuning stages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DA-DPO consistently improves multimodal preference optimization, yielding stronger robustness to hallucinations and better generalization across standard benchmarks, while remaining computationally efficient.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a shift from numerical pattern fitting to semantic, context-aware behavioral reasoning, yet existing LLM applications lack domain-specific adaptation and visual context. This study introduces Pedestrian Crossing LLM (PedX-LLM), a vision-and-knowledge enhanced framework designed to transform pedestrian crossing inference from site-specific pattern recognition to generalizable behavioral reasoning. By integrating LLaVA-extracted visual features with textual data and transportation domain knowledge, PedX-LLM fine-tunes a LLaMA-2-7B foundation model via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to infer crossing decisions. PedX-LLM achieves 82.0% balanced accuracy, outperforming the best statistical and supervised learning methods. Results demonstrate that the vision-augmented module contributes a 2.9% performance gain by capturing the built environment and integrating domain knowledge yields an additional 4.1% improvement. To evaluate generalizability across unseen environments, cross-site validation was conducted using site-based partitioning. The zero-shot PedX-LLM configuration achieves 66.9% balanced accuracy on five unseen test sites, outperforming the baseline data-driven methods by at least 18 percentage points. Incorporating just five validation examples via few-shot learning to PedX-LLM further elevates the balanced accuracy to 72.2%. PedX-LLM demonstrates strong generalizability to unseen scenarios, confirming that vision-and-knowledge-enhanced reasoning enables the model to mimic human-like decision logic and overcome the limitations of purely data-driven methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "PedX-LLM\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u65ad\u884c\u4eba\u8fc7\u8857\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u884c\u4eba\u8fc7\u8857\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002LLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4ece\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u5f0f\u62df\u5408\u8f6c\u5411\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5e94\u7528\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPedX-LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLaVA\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u5fae\u8c03LLaMA-2-7B\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u884c\u4eba\u8fc7\u8857\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "PedX-LLM\u8fbe\u523082.0%\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u4f73\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u5e26\u67652.9%\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\u6210\u5e26\u6765\u989d\u59164.1%\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u672a\u89c1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ad9\u70b9\u4e0a\uff0c\u96f6-shot\u914d\u7f6e\u8fbe\u523066.9%\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5c11-shot\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u4ec55\u4e2a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6837\u672c\uff09\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u523072.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "PedX-LLM\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Directly pooling their data to learn a shared reward function is typically impractical due to differences in dynamics, privacy constraints, and limited communication bandwidth. This paper introduces an optimal transport-based approach to federated inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Each client first performs lightweight Maximum Entropy IRL locally, adhering to its computational and privacy limitations. The resulting reward functions are then fused via a Wasserstein barycenter, which considers their underlying geometric structure.

We introduce Quantum King-Ring Domination (QKRD), a NISQ-scale benchmark derived from chess tactical positions that provides 5,000 structured instances with one-hot constraints, spatial locality, and 10--40 qubit scale. The benchmark pairs human-interpretable coverage metrics with intrinsic validation against classical heuristics, enabling algorithmic conclusions without external oracles. Using QKRD, we systematically evaluate QAOA design choices and find that constraint-preserving mixers (XY, domain-wall) converge approximately 13 steps faster than standard mixers (p<10^{-7}, d\\approx0.5) while eliminating penalty tuning, warm-start strategies reduce convergence by 45 steps (p<10^{-127}, d=3.35) with energy improvements exceeding d=8, and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization yields an informative negative result with worse energy (p<10^{-40}, d=1.21) and no coverage benefit. Intrinsic validation shows QAOA outperforms greedy heuristics by 12.6\\% and random selection by 80.1\\%.

Each part of this system is at risk of fault due to pressure tolerance, launcher pressure, and environmental circumstances. Common faults are line to line fault and open circuit for the photovoltaic subsystem, short circuit and open circuit IGBT at DC to DC converter, and regulator fault of the ground battery. The system is simulated without fault based on a neural network using solar radiation and solar panel's surface temperature as input data and current and load as outputs. Finally, using the neural network classifier, different faults are diagnosed by pattern and type of fault.

Most traditional approaches depend on utilizing handcrafted features, which are problem-dependent and optimal for specific tasks. Moreover, they are highly susceptible to dynamical events such as illumination changes, camera jitter, and variations in object sizes. On the other hand, the proposed feature learning approaches are cheaper and easier because highly abstract and discriminative features can be produced automatically without the need of expert knowledge. In this paper, we utilize automatic feature learning methods, which combine optical flow and three different deep models (i.e., supervised convolutional neural network (S-CNN), pretrained CNN feature extractor, and hierarchical extreme learning machine) for human detection in videos captured using a nonstatic camera on an aerial platform with varying altitudes. The models are trained and tested on the publicly available and highly challenging UCF-ARG aerial dataset. The comparison between these models in terms of training, testing accuracy, and learning speed is analyzed. The performance evaluation considers five human actions (digging, waving, throwing, walking, and running). Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed methods are successful for the human detection task. The pretrained CNN produces an average accuracy of 98.09%. S-CNN produces an average accuracy of 95.6% with softmax and 91.7% with Support Vector Machines (SVM). H-ELM has an average accuracy of 95.9%. Using a normal Central Processing Unit (CPU), H-ELM's training time takes 445 seconds. Learning in S-CNN takes 770 seconds with a high-performance Graphical Processing Unit (GPU).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u5149\u6d41\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u76d1\u7763CNN\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3CNN\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u6781\u9650\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u975e\u9759\u6001\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728UCF-ARG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bf9\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u6296\u52a8\u7b49\u52a8\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u654f\u611f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5149\u6d41\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1) \u76d1\u7763\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08S-CNN\uff09\uff0c2) \u9884\u8bad\u7ec3CNN\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c3) \u5206\u5c42\u6781\u9650\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\uff08H-ELM\uff09\u3002\u5728UCF-ARG\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u822a\u62cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u79cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08\u6316\u6398\u3001\u6325\u624b\u3001\u6295\u63b7\u3001\u884c\u8d70\u3001\u5954\u8dd1\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3CNN\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe98.09%\uff1bS-CNN\u4f7f\u7528softmax\u8fbe\u523095.6%\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SVM\u8fbe\u523091.7%\uff1bH-ELM\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a95.9%\u3002H-ELM\u5728CPU\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a445\u79d2\uff0cS-CNN\u5728GPU\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a770\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u89c6\u9891\u4eba\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3CNN\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0cH-ELM\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

While this mechanism effectively mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, it imposes a strictly additive inductive bias on feature transformations, thereby limiting the network's capacity to model complex state transitions. In this paper, we introduce Deep Delta Learning (DDL), a novel architecture that generalizes the standard residual connection by modulating the identity shortcut with a learnable, data-dependent geometric transformation. This transformation, termed the Delta Operator, constitutes a rank-1 perturbation of the identity matrix, parameterized by a reflection direction vector $\\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{X})$ and a gating scalar $\u03b2(\\mathbf{X})$. We provide a spectral analysis of this operator, demonstrating that the gate $\u03b2(\\mathbf{X})$ enables dynamic interpolation between identity mapping, orthogonal projection, and geometric reflection. Furthermore, we restructure the residual update as a synchronous rank-1 injection, where the gate acts as a dynamic step size governing both the erasure of old information and the writing of new features. This unification empowers the network to explicitly control the spectrum of its layer-wise transition operator, enabling the modeling of complex, non-monotonic dynamics while preserving the stable training characteristics of gated residual architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "DDL\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\uff08Delta\u7b97\u5b50\uff09\u8c03\u5236\u6052\u7b49\u6377\u5f84\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u53d6\u4ee3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u52a0\u6cd5\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u591f\u5efa\u6a21\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6052\u7b49\u6377\u5f84\u8fde\u63a5\u867d\u7136\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5f3a\u52a0\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u52a0\u6cd5\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df1\u5ea6Delta\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DDL\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u3001\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\uff08Delta\u7b97\u5b50\uff09\u8c03\u5236\u6052\u7b49\u6377\u5f84\u8fde\u63a5\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u5b50\u662f\u5bf9\u5355\u4f4d\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u79e9-1\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u7531\u53cd\u5c04\u65b9\u5411\u5411\u91cfk(X)\u548c\u95e8\u63a7\u6807\u91cf\u03b2(X)\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u95e8\u63a7\u03b2(X)\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6052\u7b49\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u53cd\u5c04\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u63d2\u503c\u3002\u5c06\u6b8b\u5dee\u66f4\u65b0\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u540c\u6b65\u79e9-1\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u95e8\u63a7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u6b65\u957f\u63a7\u5236\u65e7\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u64e6\u9664\u548c\u65b0\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5199\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "DDL\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u6b8b\u5dee\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u5c42\u95f4\u8f6c\u79fb\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u8c31\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u95e8\u63a7\u6b8b\u5dee\u67b6\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u7684\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u52a8\u6001\u3002"}}

While stochastic sampling enables the exploration of denoising directions, existing methods which optimize over multiple denoising steps suffer from sparse and ambiguous reward signals. We observe that the high entropy steps enable more efficient and effective exploration while the low entropy steps result in undistinguished roll-outs. To this end, we propose E-GRPO, an entropy aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to increase the entropy of SDE sampling steps. Since the integration of stochastic differential equations suffer from ambiguous reward signals due to stochasticity from multiple steps, we specifically merge consecutive low entropy steps to formulate one high entropy step for SDE sampling, while applying ODE sampling on other steps. Building upon this, we introduce multi-step group normalized advantage, which computes group-relative advantages within samples sharing the same consolidated SDE denoising step.

This growing reliance has raised increasing concerns regarding model interpretability and accountability, particularly as legal and regulatory frameworks place tighter constraints on using black-box models in critical applications. Although interpretable ML has attracted substantial attention, systematic evaluations of inherently interpretable models, especially for tabular data, remain relatively scarce and often focus primarily on aggregated performance outcomes.\n  To address this gap, we present a large-scale comparative evaluation of 16 inherently interpretable methods, ranging from classical linear models and decision trees to more recent approaches such as Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs), Symbolic Regression (SR), and Generalized Optimal Sparse Decision Trees (GOSDT). Our study spans 216 real-world tabular datasets and goes beyond aggregate rankings by stratifying performance according to structural dataset characteristics, including dimensionality, sample size, linearity, and class imbalance. In addition, we assess training time and robustness under controlled distributional shifts. Our results reveal clear performance hierarchies, especially for regression tasks, where EBMs consistently achieve strong predictive accuracy. At the same time, we show that performance is highly context-dependent: SR and Interpretable Generalized Additive Neural Networks (IGANNs) perform particularly well in non-linear regimes, while GOSDT models exhibit pronounced sensitivity to class imbalance. Overall, these findings provide practical guidance for practitioners seeking a balance between interpretability and predictive performance, and contribute to a deeper empirical understanding of interpretable modeling for tabular data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5bf916\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728216\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u8d23\u4efb\u6027\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5bf9\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff09\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f8\u5bf9\u7f3a\u4e4f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u805a\u5408\u6027\u80fd\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5bf916\u79cd\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ecf\u5178\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u4ee5\u53caEBMs\u3001\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u3001GOSDT\u7b49\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6db5\u76d6216\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u5ea6\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5c42\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cEBMs\u59cb\u7ec8\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1aSR\u548cIGANNs\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u800cGOSDT\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u5bfb\u6c42\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u6df1\u4e86\u5bf9\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u805a\u5408\u6392\u540d\u3002"}}

However, most previous studies focused on static scenarios where the data and concepts are assumed to be fixed and clean. In real-world applications, deployed models require continuous maintenance: we often need to remove erroneous or sensitive data (unlearning), correct mislabeled concepts, or incorporate newly acquired samples (incremental learning) to adapt to evolving environments. Thus, deriving efficient editable CBMs without retraining from scratch remains a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale applications. To address these challenges, we propose Controllable Concept Bottleneck Models (CCBMs). Specifically, CCBMs support three granularities of model editing: concept-label-level, concept-level, and data-level, the latter of which encompasses both data removal and data addition. CCBMs enjoy mathematically rigorous closed-form approximations derived from influence functions that obviate the need for retraining.

This model class assumes the existence of an (unknown) label hierarchy $L_1 \\subseteq L_2 \\subseteq \\dots \\subseteq L_r = [n]$, where labels in $L_1$ are simple functions of the input, while for $i > 1$, labels in $L_i$ are simple functions of simpler labels.\n  Our class surpasses models that were previously shown to be learnable by deep learning algorithms, in the sense that it reaches the depth limit of efficient learnability. That is, there are models in this class that require polynomial depth to express, whereas previous models can be computed by log-depth circuits.\n  Furthermore, we suggest that learnability of such hierarchical models might eventually form a basis for understanding deep learning. Beyond their natural fit for domains where deep learning excels, we argue that the mere existence of human ``teachers\" supports the hypothesis that hierarchical structures are inherently available. By providing granular labels, teachers effectively reveal ``hints'' or ``snippets'' of the internal algorithms used by the brain. We formalize this intuition, showing that in a simplified model where a teacher is partially aware of their internal logic, a hierarchical structure emerges that facilitates efficient learnability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5c42\u95f4SGD\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6559\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6807\u7b7e\u5982\u4f55\u63ed\u793a\u5927\u8111\u5185\u90e8\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4eba\u7c7b\u6559\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6807\u7b7e\u5982\u4f55\u63ed\u793a\u5927\u8111\u5185\u90e8\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5c42\u95f4SGD\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u672a\u77e5\u6807\u7b7e\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1aL\u2081 \u2286 L\u2082 \u2286 ... \u2286 L\u1d63 = [n]\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dL\u2081\u6807\u7b7e\u662f\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u800ci>1\u65f6\uff0cL\u1d62\u6807\u7b7e\u662f\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9700\u8981\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6df1\u5ea6\u8868\u8fbe\u800c\u4e4b\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u53ea\u80fd\u7531\u5bf9\u6570\u6df1\u5ea6\u7535\u8def\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c42\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6559\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u5316\u6807\u7b7e\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u8111\u5185\u90e8\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\"\u63d0\u793a\"\u6216\"\u7247\u6bb5\"\uff0c\u5728\u6559\u5e08\u90e8\u5206\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u3002"}}

Many existing distribution-matching approaches struggle in this regime because they impose strict support constraints and rely on brittle one-step models, making it hard to extract useful signal from imperfect data. To tackle this challenge, we propose TGE, a trajectory-level generative embedding for offline LfO that constructs a dense, smooth surrogate reward by estimating expert state density in the latent space of a temporal diffusion model trained on offline trajectory data. By leveraging the smooth geometry of the learned diffusion embedding, TGE captures long-horizon temporal dynamics and effectively bridges the gap between disjoint supports, ensuring a robust learning signal even when offline data is distributionally distinct from the expert.

These findings demonstrate that weight-space regularization neither achieves its geometric goal nor reliably improves performance, making it unsuitable for MoE diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u5728MoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e13\u5bb6\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u65e2\u4e0d\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u51e0\u4f55\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5728MoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e13\u5bb6\u591a\u6837\u6027", "method": "\u5728MoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u4e13\u5bb6\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u57287\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u60c5\u51b5", "result": "\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u5728\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u5931\u8d25\uff1a\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u53e0\u4e0d\u964d\u53cd\u589e\uff08MSO\u589e\u52a0\u8fbe114%\uff09\uff0c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u53e0\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4f4d\uff08\u7ea60.6\uff09\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff08WikiText-103\u5fae\u964d0.9%\uff0cTinyStories\u5fae\u53470.9%\uff0cPTB\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6ce2\u52a8\uff09\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff08r=-0.293\uff0cp=0.523\uff09", "conclusion": "\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65e2\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u7528\u4e8eMoE\u591a\u6837\u6027\u589e\u5f3a"}}

A comparative analysis of the numerical solution of the (viscid and inviscid) Burgers and Eikonal equations via standard numerical discretization (also cast in terms of neural chains) and via PINN's learning is presented and commented on. It is found that standard numerical discretization and PINN learning provide two different paths to acquire essentially the same knowledge about the dynamics of the system. PINN learning proceeds through random matrices which bear no direct relation to the highly structured matrices associated with finite-difference (FD) procedures. Random matrices leading to acceptable solutions are far more numerous than the unique tridiagonal form in matrix space, which explains why the PINN search typically lands on the random ensemble. The price is a much larger number of parameters, causing lack of physical transparency (explainability) as well as large training costs with no counterpart in the FD procedure.

Brown"], "title": "Detecting Spike Wave Discharges (SWD) using 1-dimensional Residual UNet", "comment": null, "summary": "The manual labeling of events in electroencephalography (EEG) records is time-consuming. This is especially true when EEG recordings are taken continuously over weeks to months. Therefore, a method to automatically label pertinent EEG events reduces the manual workload. Spike wave discharges (SWD), which are the electrographic hallmark of absence seizures, are EEG events that are often labeled manually. While some previous studies have utilized machine learning to automatically segment and classify EEG signals like SWDs, they can be improved. Here we compare the performance of 14 machine learning classifiers on our own manually annotated dataset of 961 hours of EEG recordings from C3H/HeJ mice, including 22,637 labeled SWDs. We find that a 1D UNet performs best for labeling SWDs in this dataset. We also improve the 1D UNet by augmenting our training data and determine that scaling showed the greatest benefit of all augmentation procedures applied.

It can be challenging especially for mid to small retail industries. This paper examines LSTM model compression by gradually reducing the number of hidden units from 128 to 16. We used the Kaggle Store Item Demand Forecasting dataset, which has 913,000 daily sales records from 10 stores and 50 items, to look at the trade-off between model size and how accurate the predictions are. Experiments show that lowering the number of hidden LSTM units to 64 maintains the same level of accuracy while also improving it. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranges from 23.6% for the full 128-unit model to 12.4% for the 64-unit model. The optimized model is 73% smaller (from 280KB to 76KB) and 47% more accurate.

We introduce a principled joint penalty for the collection of user reward functions $\\{f_u\\}$, combining a graph smoothness term based on RKHS distances with an individual roughness penalty. Our central contribution is proving that this penalty is equivalent to the squared norm within a single, unified \\emph{multi-user RKHS}. We explicitly derive its reproducing kernel, which elegantly fuses the graph Laplacian with the base arm kernel. This unification allows us to reframe the problem as learning a single ''lifted'' function, enabling the design of principled algorithms, \\texttt{LK-GP-UCB} and \\texttt{LK-GP-TS}, that leverage Gaussian Process posteriors over this new kernel for exploration. We provide high-probability regret bounds that scale with an \\emph{effective dimension} of the multi-user kernel, replacing dependencies on user count or ambient dimension. Empirically, our methods outperform strong linear and non-graph-aware baselines in non-linear settings and remain competitive even when the true rewards are linear.

Our empirical analysis reveals that even under controlled initialization and training conditions, the accuracy of the model can exhibit significant variability. To address this issue, we propose a Custom Loss Function (CLF) that reduces the sensitivity of training outcomes to stochastic factors such as weight initialization and data shuffling.

We reveal a critical reliability crisis: 50-69\\% of correct answers from these models contain fundamentally flawed reasoning -- a ``Right-for-Wrong-Reasons'' phenomenon invisible to standard accuracy metrics. Through analysis of 10,734 reasoning traces across three models and diverse tasks, we introduce the Reasoning Integrity Score (RIS), a process-based metric validated with substantial inter-rater agreement ($\u03ba=0.657$). Conventional practices are challenged by our findings: while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) significantly improves reasoning integrity (Cohen's $d=0.23$--$0.93$), meta-cognitive interventions like self-critique often harm performance ($d=-0.14$ to $-0.33$) in small models on the evaluated tasks. Mechanistic analysis reveals RAG succeeds by grounding calculations in external evidence, reducing errors by 7.6\\%, while meta-cognition amplifies confusion without sufficient model capacity. To enable deployment, verification capabilities are distilled into a neural classifier achieving 0.86 F1-score with 100$\\times$ speedup.

Thus, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a computation-efficient solution, which activates only a sparse subset of experts during model training to reduce computing burden without sacrificing performance. Though integrating MoE into FL fine-tuning holds significant potential, it still encounters three key challenges: i) selecting appropriate experts for clients remains challenging due to the lack of a reliable metric to measure each expert's impact on local fine-tuning performance, ii) the heterogeneous computing resources across clients severely hinder MoE-based LLM fine-tuning, as dynamic expert activations across diverse input samples can overwhelm resource-constrained devices, and iii) client-specific expert subsets and routing preference undermine global aggregation, where misaligned expert updates and inconsistent gating networks in troduce destructive interference. To address these challenges, we propose HFedMoE, a heterogeneous MoE-based FL fine-tuning framework that customizes a subset of experts to each client for computation-efficient LLM fine-tuning. Specifically, HFedMoE identifies the expert importance based on its contributions to fine-tuning performance, and then adaptively selects a subset of experts from an information bottleneck perspective to align with each client' s computing budget. A sparsity-aware model aggregation strategy is also designed to aggregate the actively fine-tuned experts and gating parameters with importance weighted contributions.

We study the maximization of a nonnegative, non-monotone $\u03b3$-weakly DR-submodular function over a down-closed convex body. Our main result is an approximation algorithm whose guarantee depends smoothly on $\u03b3$; in particular, when $\u03b3=1$ (the DR-submodular case) our bound recovers the $0.401$ approximation factor, while for $\u03b3<1$ the guarantee degrades gracefully and, it improves upon previously reported bounds for $\u03b3$-weakly DR-submodular maximization under the same constraints. Our approach combines a Frank-Wolfe-guided continuous-greedy framework with a $\u03b3$-aware double-greedy step, yielding a simple yet effective procedure for handling non-monotonicity. This results in state-of-the-art guarantees for non-monotone $\u03b3$-weakly DR-submodular maximization over down-closed convex bodies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5411\u4e0b\u5c01\u95ed\u51f8\u4f53\u4e0a\u6700\u5927\u5316\u975e\u8d1f\u3001\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u03b3-\u5f31DR-\u6b21\u6a21\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u968f\u03b3\u5e73\u6ed1\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u03b3=1\u65f6\u6062\u590d0.401\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u03b3<1\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u96c5\u4e0b\u964d\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u6b21\u6a21\u76ee\u6807\u6700\u5927\u5316\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5411\u4e0b\u5c01\u95ed\u51f8\u4f53\u4e0a\u6700\u5927\u5316\u975e\u8d1f\u3001\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u03b3-\u5f31DR-\u6b21\u6a21\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408Frank-Wolfe\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8d2a\u5a6a\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u03b3\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53cc\u8d2a\u5a6a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u968f\u03b3\u5e73\u6ed1\u53d8\u5316\uff1a\u5f53\u03b3=1\uff08DR-\u6b21\u6a21\u60c5\u51b5\uff09\u65f6\u6062\u590d0.401\u8fd1\u4f3c\u56e0\u5b50\uff1b\u5f53\u03b3<1\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f18\u96c5\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u03b3-\u5f31DR-\u6b21\u6a21\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5411\u4e0b\u5c01\u95ed\u51f8\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u03b3-\u5f31DR-\u6b21\u6a21\u6700\u5927\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u8d2a\u5a6a\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u03b3\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53cc\u8d2a\u5a6a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4e86\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While multimodal data provide complementary information, many existing computational models struggle with interpretability, class imbalance, or effective fusion of high-dimensional imaging and tabular clinical features. To address these limitations, we propose the Class-Weighted Sparse-Attention Fusion Network (SAFN), an interpretable deep learning framework for robust multimodal profiling. SAFN integrates MRI cortical thickness, MRI volumetric measures, clinical assessments, and demographic variables using modality-specific encoders and a symmetric cross-attention mechanism that captures nonlinear interactions between imaging and clinical representations. A sparsity-constrained attention-gating fusion layer dynamically prioritises informative modalities, while a class-balanced focal loss (beta = 0.999, gamma = 1.5) mitigates dataset imbalance without synthetic oversampling. Evaluated on 703 participants (570 PD, 133 healthy controls) from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative using subject-wise five-fold cross-validation, SAFN achieves an accuracy of 0.98 plus or minus 0.02 and a PR-AUC of 1.00 plus or minus 0.00, outperforming established machine learning and deep learning baselines. Interpretability analysis shows a clinically coherent decision process, with approximately 60 percent of predictive weight assigned to clinical assessments, consistent with Movement Disorder Society diagnostic principles.

However, current models do not yet convey the feeling of truly interactive communication, often generating one-way responses that lack emotional engagement. We identify two key challenges toward truly interactive avatars: generating motion in real-time under causal constraints and learning expressive, vibrant reactions without additional labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose Avatar Forcing, a new framework for interactive head avatar generation that models real-time user-avatar interactions through diffusion forcing. This design allows the avatar to process real-time multimodal inputs, including the user's audio and motion, with low latency for instant reactions to both verbal and non-verbal cues such as speech, nods, and laughter. Furthermore, we introduce a direct preference optimization method that leverages synthetic losing samples constructed by dropping user conditions, enabling label-free learning of expressive interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enables real-time interaction with low latency (approximately 500ms), achieving 6.8X speedup compared to the baseline, and produces reactive and expressive avatar motion, which is preferred over 80% against the baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAvatar Forcing\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u5f3a\u8feb\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u60c5\u611f\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff08\u7ea6500ms\uff09\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u53cd\u5e94", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6c9f\u901a\u611f\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u5355\u5411\u54cd\u5e94\u800c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u60c5\u611f\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u989d\u5916\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u3001\u751f\u52a8\u7684\u53cd\u5e94", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAvatar Forcing\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u5f3a\u8feb\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u65f6\u7528\u6237-\u5934\u50cf\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\uff08\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u901a\u8fc7\u4e22\u5f03\u7528\u6237\u6761\u4ef6\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5408\u6210\u635f\u5931\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ea6500ms\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u52a0\u901f6.8\u500d\u3002\u751f\u6210\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u5934\u50cf\u8fd0\u52a8\u5728\u8d85\u8fc780%\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf", "conclusion": "Avatar Forcing\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3a\u865a\u62df\u6c9f\u901a\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f53\u9a8c"}}

However, widely used pairwise GRMs create a computational bottleneck when integrated with RL algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This bottleneck arises from two factors: (i) the O(n^2) time complexity of pairwise comparisons required to obtain relative scores, and (ii) the computational overhead of repeated sampling or additional chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to improve performance. To address the first factor, we propose Intergroup Relative Preference Optimization (IRPO), a novel RL framework that incorporates the well-established Bradley-Terry model into GRPO. By generating a pointwise score for each response, IRPO enables efficient evaluation of arbitrarily many candidates during RL training while preserving interpretability and fine-grained reward signals. Experimental results demonstrate that IRPO achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among pointwise GRMs across multiple benchmarks, with performance comparable to that of current leading pairwise GRMs. Furthermore, we show that IRPO significantly outperforms pairwise GRMs in post-training evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faIRPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06Bradley-Terry\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5230GRPO\u4e2d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6210\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u70b9\u5f0f\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6210\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08GRMs\uff09\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0eGRPO\u7b49\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u96c6\u6210\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff1a1\uff09\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u9700\u8981O(n^2)\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b2\uff09\u91cd\u590d\u91c7\u6837\u6216\u989d\u5916\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u5e26\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIntergroup Relative Preference Optimization\uff08IRPO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06Bradley-Terry\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5230GRPO\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u70b9\u5f0f\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5019\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "IRPO\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u70b9\u5f0fGRMs\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u9886\u5148\u7684\u6210\u5bf9GRMs\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cIRPO\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6210\u5bf9GRMs\u3002", "conclusion": "IRPO\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u6210\u5bf9GRMs\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a cloud-native architecture using diffusion models to automatically generate store-specific planograms. Unlike conventional optimization methods that reorganize existing layouts, our system learns from successful shelf arrangements across multiple retail locations to create new planogram configurations. The architecture combines cloud-based model training via AWS with edge deployment for real-time inference. The diffusion model integrates retail-specific constraints through a modified loss function.

This design typically achieves higher sample efficiency than purely on-policy methods. However, critic networks tend to overestimate value estimates systematically. This is often addressed by introducing a pessimistic bias based on uncertainty estimates. Current methods employ ensembling to quantify the critic's epistemic uncertainty-uncertainty due to limited data and model ambiguity-to scale pessimistic updates. In this work, we propose a new algorithm called Stochastic Actor-Critic (STAC) that incorporates temporal (one-step) aleatoric uncertainty-uncertainty arising from stochastic transitions, rewards, and policy-induced variability in Bellman targets-to scale pessimistic bias in temporal-difference updates, rather than relying on epistemic uncertainty. STAC uses a single distributional critic network to model the temporal return uncertainty, and applies dropout to both the critic and actor networks for regularization. Our results show that pessimism based on a distributional critic alone suffices to mitigate overestimation, and naturally leads to risk-averse behavior in stochastic environments. Introducing dropout further improves training stability and performance by means of regularization. With this design, STAC achieves improved computational efficiency using a single distributional critic network.", "AI": {"tldr": "STAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6027\u968f\u673a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u7f29\u653e\u60b2\u89c2\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7dropout\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7f51\u7edc\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9ad8\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u96c6\u6210\u6280\u672f\u91cf\u5316\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u5f15\u5165\u60b2\u89c2\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u968f\u673a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSTAC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u6027\u968f\u673a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u6765\u81ea\u968f\u673a\u8f6c\u79fb\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u7684\u60b2\u89c2\u504f\u5dee\uff1b3\uff09\u5bf9\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u548c\u6f14\u5458\u7f51\u7edc\u5e94\u7528dropout\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7684\u60b2\u89c2\u504f\u5dee\u5c31\u8db3\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u9ad8\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u968f\u673a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u751f\u98ce\u9669\u89c4\u907f\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165dropout\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff1b4\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "STAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u6027\u968f\u673a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u800c\u975e\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u7f29\u653e\u60b2\u89c2\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u968f\u673a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u89c4\u907f\u7279\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

While many drift detection heuristics exist, most lack a principled dynamical interpretation and provide limited guidance on how retraining frequency should be balanced against operational cost. In this work, we propose an entropy--based retraining framework grounded in nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics. Modeling deployment--time data drift as probability flow governed by a Fokker--Planck equation, we quantify model--data mismatch using a time--evolving Kullback--Leibler divergence. We show that the time derivative of this mismatch admits an entropy--balance decomposition featuring a nonnegative entropy production term driven by probability currents. This interpretation motivates entropy--triggered retraining as a label--free intervention strategy that responds to accumulated mismatch rather than delayed performance collapse.

We propose FedHypeVAE, a differentially private, hypernetwork-driven framework for synthesizing embedding-level data across decentralized clients. Building on a conditional VAE backbone, we replace the single global decoder and fixed latent prior with client-aware decoders and class-conditional priors generated by a shared hypernetwork from private, trainable client codes. This bi-level design personalizes the generative layerrather than the downstream modelwhile decoupling local data from communicated parameters. The shared hypernetwork is optimized under differential privacy, ensuring that only noise-perturbed, clipped gradients are aggregated across clients. A local MMD alignment between real and synthetic embeddings and a Lipschitz regularizer on hypernetwork outputs further enhance stability and distributional coherence under non-IID conditions.

Among these, the theory of non-robust features proposed by Ilyas et al. has been widely accepted, showing that brittle but predictive features of the data distribution can be directly exploited by attackers. However, this theory overlooks adversarial samples that do not directly utilize these features. In this work, we advocate that these two kinds of samples - those which use use brittle but predictive features and those that do not - comprise two types of adversarial weaknesses and should be differentiated when evaluating adversarial robustness. For this purpose, we propose an ensemble-based metric to measure the manipulation of non-robust features by adversarial perturbations and use this metric to analyze the makeup of adversarial samples generated by attackers. This new perspective also allows us to re-examine multiple phenomena, including the impact of sharpness-aware minimization on adversarial robustness and the robustness gap observed between adversarially training and standard training on robust datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u533a\u5206\u4e24\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5f31\u70b9\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u975e\u9c81\u68d2\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u4e0d\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u975e\u9c81\u68d2\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u64cd\u7eb5\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u975e\u9c81\u68d2\u7279\u5f81\u7406\u8bba\u867d\u7136\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a5\u53d7\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u90a3\u4e9b\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6837\u672c\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u533a\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8861\u91cf\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u5bf9\u975e\u9c81\u68d2\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u64cd\u7eb5\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u5206\u6790\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6784\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9510\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u533a\u5206\u4e24\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5f31\u70b9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u76f8\u5173\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

By treating attention matrices as adjacency matrices of dynamic graphs over tokens, we extract four interpretable spectral diagnostics, the Fiedler value (algebraic connectivity), high-frequency energy ratio (HFER), graph signal smoothness, and spectral entropy, that exhibit statistically significant differences between valid and invalid mathematical proofs. Experiments across seven transformer models from four independent architectural families (Meta Llama, Alibaba Qwen, Microsoft Phi, and Mistral AI) demonstrate that this spectral signature produces effect sizes up to Cohen's $d = 3.30$ ($p < 10^{-116}$), enabling 85.0--95.6\\% classification accuracy under rigorous evaluation, with calibrated thresholds reaching 93--95\\% on the full dataset. The method requires no training data, fine-tuning, or learned classifiers: a single threshold on a spectral metric suffices for high accuracy. Through systematic label correction, we discover that the spectral method detects logical coherence rather than compiler acceptance, identifying mathematically valid proofs that formal verifiers reject due to technical failures. We further identify an architectural dependency: Mistral-7B's Sliding Window Attention shifts the discriminative signal from HFER to late-layer Smoothness ($d = 2.09$, $p_{\\text{MW}} = 1.16 \\times 10^{-48}$), revealing that attention mechanism design affects which spectral features capture reasoning validity.

Existing solutions rely on physics-based models that require extensive parameterization, including aerodynamic drag coefficients and real-time wind forecasts, parameters impractical for most amateur cyclists. This work presents a machine learning approach that predicts ride duration using route topology features combined with the athlete's current fitness state derived from training load metrics. The model learns athlete-specific performance patterns from historical data, substituting complex physical measurements with historical performance proxies. We evaluate the approach using a single-athlete dataset (N=96 rides) in an N-of-1 study design. After rigorous feature engineering to eliminate data leakage, we find that Lasso regression with Topology + Fitness features achieves MAE=6.60 minutes and R2=0.922. Notably, integrating fitness metrics (CTL, ATL) reduces error by 14% compared to topology alone (MAE=7.66 min), demonstrating that physiological state meaningfully constrains performance even in self-paced efforts.

Conventional taxi hotspot prediction models often rely solely on historical demand, overlooking dynamic influences such as traffic congestion, road incidents, and public events. This paper presents a traffic-aware, graph-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework for optimal taxi placement in metropolitan environments. The urban road network is modeled as a graph where intersections represent nodes, road segments serve as edges, and node attributes capture historical demand, event proximity, and real-time congestion scores obtained from live traffic APIs. Graph Neural Network (GNN) embeddings are employed to encode spatial-temporal dependencies within the traffic network, which are then used by a Q-learning agent to recommend optimal taxi hotspots. The reward mechanism jointly optimizes passenger waiting time, driver travel distance, and congestion avoidance. Experiments on a simulated Delhi taxi dataset, generated using real geospatial boundaries and historic ride-hailing request patterns, demonstrate that the proposed model reduced passenger waiting time by about 56% and reduced travel distance by 38% compared to baseline stochastic selection. The proposed approach is adaptable to multi-modal transport systems and can be integrated into smart city platforms for real-time urban mobility optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u901a\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u57ce\u5e02\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u70ed\u70b9\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u51cf\u5c11\u4e58\u5ba2\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u53f8\u673a\u884c\u9a76\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u667a\u6167\u57ce\u5e02\u4ea4\u901a\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u70ed\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5386\u53f2\u9700\u6c42\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4ea4\u901a\u62e5\u5835\u3001\u9053\u8def\u4e8b\u6545\u3001\u516c\u5171\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7b49\u52a8\u6001\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u4f9b\u9700\u5339\u914d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u57ce\u5e02\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u4e3a\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u8def\u6bb5\u4e3a\u8fb9\uff09\uff0c\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u5305\u542b\u5386\u53f2\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u90bb\u8fd1\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u62e5\u5835\u5206\u6570\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7f16\u7801\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Q-learning\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u8350\u6700\u4f18\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u70ed\u70b9\uff1b\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e58\u5ba2\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u53f8\u673a\u884c\u9a76\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u62e5\u5835\u907f\u514d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fb7\u91cc\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u7406\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u53eb\u8f66\u8bf7\u6c42\u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u4e58\u5ba2\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea656%\uff0c\u884c\u9a76\u8ddd\u79bb\u51cf\u5c1138%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4ea4\u901a\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u56fe\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u70ed\u70b9\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u667a\u6167\u57ce\u5e02\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u57ce\u5e02\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Prior work suggests that preference-based post-training and LLM-judged evaluations can induce systematic length bias, where longer answers are rewarded even at comparable quality.\n  We introduce YapBench, a lightweight benchmark for quantifying user-visible over-generation on brevity-ideal prompts. Each item consists of a single-turn prompt, a curated minimal-sufficient baseline answer, and a category label. Our primary metric, YapScore, measures excess response length beyond the baseline in characters, enabling comparisons across models without relying on any specific tokenizer. We summarize model performance via the YapIndex, a uniformly weighted average of category-level median YapScores.\n  YapBench contains over three hundred English prompts spanning three common brevity-ideal settings: (A) minimal or ambiguous inputs where the ideal behavior is a short clarification, (B) closed-form factual questions with short stable answers, and (C) one-line coding tasks where a single command or snippet suffices. Evaluating 76 assistant LLMs, we observe an order-of-magnitude spread in median excess length and distinct category-specific failure modes, including vacuum-filling on ambiguous inputs and explanation or formatting overhead on one-line technical requests.

Accepted for presentation at WCSC 2026", "summary": "Effective exploration remains a key challenge in RL, especially with non-stationary rewards or high-dimensional policies. We introduce ARISE, a lightweight framework that enhances reinforcement learning by augmenting standard policy-gradient methods with a compact swarm-based exploration layer. ARISE blends policy actions with particle-driven proposals, where each particle represents a candidate policy trajectory sampled in the action space, and modulates exploration adaptively using reward-variance cues. While easy benchmarks exhibit only slight improvements (e.g., +0.7% on CartPole-v1), ARISE yields substantial gains on more challenging tasks, including +46% on LunarLander-v3 and +22% on Hopper-v4, while preserving stability on Walker2d and Ant. Under non-stationary reward shifts, ARISE provides marked robustness advantages, outperforming PPO by +75 points on CartPole and improving LunarLander accordingly. Ablation studies confirm that both the swarm component and the adaptive mechanism contribute to the performance.

However, deploying game-theoretic planners for autonomous decision-making requires a specification of all agents' objectives. To circumvent this practical difficulty, recent work develops maximum likelihood techniques for solving inverse games that can identify unknown agent objectives from interaction data. Unfortunately, these methods only infer point estimates and do not quantify estimator uncertainty; correspondingly, downstream planning decisions can overconfidently commit to unsafe actions. We present an approximate Bayesian inference approach for solving the inverse game problem, which can incorporate observation data from multiple modalities and be used to generate samples from the Bayesian posterior over the hidden agent objectives given limited sensor observations in real time. Concretely, the proposed Bayesian inverse game framework trains a structured variational autoencoder with an embedded differentiable Nash game solver on interaction datasets and does not require labels of agents' true objectives. Extensive experiments show that our framework successfully learns prior and posterior distributions, improves inference quality over maximum likelihood estimation-based inverse game approaches, and enables safer downstream decision-making without sacrificing efficiency. When trajectory information is uninformative or unavailable, multimodal inference further reduces uncertainty by exploiting additional observation modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9006\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u53ef\u5fae\u7eb3\u4ec0\u535a\u5f08\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4ece\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u51b3\u7b56\u5b89\u5168\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9006\u535a\u5f08\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c4\u5212\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u5730\u91c7\u53d6\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u52a8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9006\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u5fae\u7eb3\u4ec0\u535a\u5f08\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u76ee\u6807\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c2\u6d4b", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u51b3\u7b56\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6548\u7387\u3002\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9006\u535a\u5f08\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027"}}

The framework is formulated as a contextual bandit problem and solved using incremental action-value estimation with a discretized state space to select optimal precision configurations for computational steps, balancing precision and computational efficiency. To verify its effectiveness, we apply the framework to iterative refinement for solving linear systems $Ax = b$. In this application, our approach dynamically chooses precisions based on calculated features from the system. In detail, a Q-table maps discretized features (e.g., approximate condition number and matrix norm)to actions (chosen precision configurations for specific steps), optimized via an epsilon-greedy strategy to maximize a multi-objective reward balancing accuracy and computational cost.

To address this, we introduce a covariate-dependent Hidden Markov Model (CDHMM) tailored to corner kicks, a highly structured aspect of football games. Our label-free model infers time-resolved man-marking and zonal assignments directly from player tracking data.

However, as data evolve their knowledge quickly becomes outdated. Continual learning aims to update LLMs with new information without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Although methods such as full fine-tuning can incorporate new data, they are computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge is overwritten. Memory-augmented approaches address this by equipping LLMs with a memory bank, that is an external memory module which stores information for future use. However, these methods face a critical limitation, in particular, the memory bank constantly grows in the real-world scenario when large-scale data streams arrive. In this paper, we propose MBC, a model that compresses the memory bank through a codebook optimization strategy during online adaptation learning. To ensure stable learning, we also introduce an online resetting mechanism that prevents codebook collapse. In addition, we employ Key-Value Low-Rank Adaptation in the attention layers of the LLM, enabling efficient utilization of the compressed memory representations. Experiments with benchmark question-answering datasets demonstrate that MBC reduces the memory bank size to 0.3% when compared against the most competitive baseline, while maintaining high retention accuracy during online adaptation learning.

In this paper, we extend this family of relaxations by introducing a diffusion-based soft reparameterization for categorical distributions. For these distributions, the denoiser under a Gaussian noising process admits a closed form and can be computed efficiently, yielding a training-free diffusion sampler through which we can backpropagate. Our experiments show that the proposed reparameterization trick yields competitive or improved optimization performance on various benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u8f6f\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5206\u7c7b\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u53d8\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u677e\u5f1b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u8def\u5f84\u68af\u5ea6\u4f46\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u662f\u6709\u504f\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u8fd9\u7c7b\u677e\u5f1b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5206\u5e03\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u8f6f\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0b\u5206\u7c7b\u5206\u5e03\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6280\u5de7\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6216\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u8f6f\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}
