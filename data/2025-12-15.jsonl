The inherent difficulty of modeling MILPs that accurately represent stochastic real world problems leads to suboptimal performance in the real world. Recently, machine learning methods have been applied to build MILP models for decision quality rather than how accurately they model the real world problem. However, these approaches typically rely on supervised learning, assume access to true optimal decisions, and use surrogates for the MILP gradients. In this work, we introduce a proof of concept CORL framework that end to end fine tunes an MILP scheme using reinforcement learning (RL) on real world data to maximize its operational performance. We enable this by casting an MILP solved by B&B as a differentiable stochastic policy compatible with RL. We validate the CORL method in a simple illustrative combinatorial sequential decision making example."}

However, efficient combinatorial bundling of transporation jobs remains a bottleneck. We model the OFEX combinatorial bundling problem as a multi-commodity one-to-one pickup-and-delivery selective traveling salesperson problem (m1-PDSTSP), which optimizes revenue-driven freight bundling under capacity, precedence, and route-length constraints. The key challenge is to couple combinatorial bundle selection with pickup-and-delivery routing under sub-second latency. We propose a learning--accelerated hybrid search pipeline that pairs a Transformer Neural Network-based constructive policy with an innovative Multi-Start Large Neighborhood Search (MSLNS) metaheuristic within a rolling-horizon scheme in which the platform repeatedly freezes the current marketplace into a static snapshot and solves it under a short time budget. This pairing leverages the low-latency, high-quality inference of the learning-based constructor alongside the robustness of improvement search; the multi-start design and plausible seeds help LNS to explore the solution space more efficiently. Across benchmarks, our method outperforms state-of-the-art neural combinatorial optimization and metaheuristic baselines in solution quality with comparable time, achieving an optimality gap of less than 2\\% in total revenue relative to the best available exact baseline method.

Recent work demonstrates that techniques such as repeated sampling, self-verification, and self-reflection can significantly enhance task success by allocating more inference-time compute. However, applying these techniques across multiple agents in a multi-agent system is difficult: there does not exist principled mechanisms to allocate compute to foster collaboration among agents, to extend test-time scaling to collaborative interactions, or to distribute compute across agents under explicit budget constraints. To address this gap, we propose FutureWeaver, a framework for planning and optimizing test-time compute allocation in multi-agent systems under fixed budgets. FutureWeaver introduces modularized collaboration, formalized as callable functions that encapsulate reusable multi-agent workflows. These modules are automatically derived through self-play reflection by abstracting recurring interaction patterns from past trajectories. Building on these modules, FutureWeaver employs a dual-level planning architecture that optimizes compute allocation by reasoning over the current task state while also speculating on future steps. Experiments on complex agent benchmarks demonstrate that FutureWeaver consistently outperforms baselines across diverse budget settings, validating its effectiveness for multi-agent collaboration in inference-time optimization."}

We introduce an agentic large language model (LLM)-based framework for automated MDP modeling and policy generation (A-LAMP), that automatically translates free-form natural language task descriptions into an MDP formulation and trained policy. The framework decomposes modeling, coding, and training into verifiable stages, ensuring semantic alignment throughout the pipeline.

In addition, a case study also demonstrates that A-LAMP generates environments and policies that preserve the task's optimality, confirming its correctness and reliability."}

Traditional recommender systems primarily rely on user behavioral data such as clicks, views, or ratings, while neglecting users' real-time emotional and intentional states during content interaction. To address this limitation, this study proposes a Multi-Modal Emotion and Intent Recognition Model (MMEI) based on a BERT-based Cross-Modal Transformer with Attention-Based Fusion, integrated into a cloud-native personalized AIGC recommendation framework. The proposed system jointly processes visual (facial expression), auditory (speech tone), and textual (comments or utterances) modalities through pretrained encoders ViT, Wav2Vec2, and BERT, followed by an attention-based fusion module to learn emotion-intent representations. These embeddings are then used to drive personalized content recommendations through a contextual matching layer. Experiments conducted on benchmark emotion datasets (AIGC-INT, MELD, and CMU-MOSEI) and an AIGC interaction dataset demonstrate that the proposed MMEI model achieves a 4.3% improvement in F1-score and a 12.3% reduction in cross-entropy loss compared to the best fusion-based transformer baseline. Furthermore, user-level online evaluations reveal that emotion-driven recommendations increase engagement time by 15.2% and enhance satisfaction scores by 11.8%, confirming the model's effectiveness in aligning AI-generated content with users' affective and intentional states. This work highlights the potential of cross-modal emotional intelligence for next-generation AIGC ecosystems, enabling adaptive, empathetic, and context-aware recommendation experiences."}

Existing datasets rely on human demonstrations, limiting scalability. A natural alternative is to synthesize data from strong CUAs, yet their rollouts are highly noisy, with incorrect or suboptimal actions consisting a large proportion of the steps, making naive imitation ineffective. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline that transforms noisy rollouts into reliable supervision without human annotation. The core idea is step-level filtering, which evaluates actions individually to retain only correct steps, complemented by reasoning augmentation for improved planning. Using this pipeline, we construct WebSTAR, a dataset of 13.3K trajectories and 100K graded, reasoning-rich steps synthesized from OpenAI's computer-use-preview model. We train Qwen-2.5-VL-Instruct models (7B and 32B) on WebSTAR. On WebVoyager, our 7B model surpasses SoTA open-source CUA model UI-TARS-1.5-7B by more than 15% with only supervised finetuning. Building on step-level grading, we further create WebSCORE, a dataset of graded step-level actions, and train StepRM, a 7B multimodal reward model distilled from o4-mini, which matches its grading quality while being far more efficient to deploy at scale. Our results establish step-level filtering as a key principle for scalable CUA training and construct two new datasets (WebSTAR, WebSCORE) and a lightweight reward model (StepRM) as practical tools to advance robust and efficient CUAs."}

However, it often requires discretizing items into multi-code representations (e.g., typically four code tokens or more), which sharply increases the length of the original item sequence.

To mitigate this issue, we propose FAIR, the first generative recommendation framework with focused attention, which enhances attention scores to relevant context while suppressing those to irrelevant ones. Specifically, we propose (1) a focused attention mechanism integrated into the standard Transformer, which learns two separate sets of Q and K attention weights and computes their difference as the final attention scores to eliminate attention noise while focusing on relevant contexts; (2) a noise-robustness objective, which encourages the model to maintain stable attention patterns under stochastic perturbations, preventing undesirable shifts toward irrelevant context due to noise; and (3) a mutual information maximization objective, which guides the model to identify contexts that are most informative for next-item prediction. We validate the effectiveness of FAIR on four public benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods."}

This often leads to topology-first designs and suboptimal cost-effectiveness when budgets are binding. We present AgentBalance, a framework for constructing cost-effective MAS under explicit token-cost and latency budgets via a backbone-then-topology design. AgentBalance first performs backbone-oriented agent generation, constructing agents with heterogeneous backbones through LLM pool construction, pool selection, and role-backbone matching.

Experiments on benchmarks with 14 candidate LLM backbones show that AgentBalance achieves up to 10% and 22% performance gains under matched token-cost and latency budgets, respectively, and yields strong AUC on performance-versus-budget curves across benchmarks. AgentBalance also functions as a plug-in for existing MAS, improving performance under the same token-cost and latency constraints, and it generalizes well to unseen LLMs for practical, budget-aware deployment.

More concerningly, even a simple linear model with commonly used baselines contradicts itself by designating different optimal methods. A question then arises: which baseline should we use? We propose to study this problem through two desirable properties of a baseline: (i) that it removes information and (ii) that it does not produce overly out-of-distribution (OOD) images. We first show that none of the tested baselines satisfy both criteria, and there appears to be a trade-off among current baselines: either they remove information or they produce a sequence of OOD images. Finally, we introduce a novel baseline by leveraging recent work in feature visualisation to artificially produce a model-dependent baseline that removes information without being overly OOD, thus improving on the trade-off when compared to other existing baselines.

While classical methods like Integer Linear Programming (ILP) guarantee optimal solutions, they face exponential scaling with grid size, and recent advances in machine learning offer promising alternatives for pattern-based approximation. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of classical optimization and AI approaches to this problem, evaluating their performance against traditional algorithms. We apply PatternBoost transformer learning and reinforcement learning (PPO) to this problem for the first time, comparing them against ILP. ILP achieves provably optimal solutions up to 19 by 19 grids, while PatternBoost matches optimal performance up to 14 by 14 grids with 96% test loss reduction. PPO achieves perfect solutions on 10 by 10 grids but fails at 11 by 11 grids, where constraint violations prevent valid configurations. These results demonstrate that classical optimization remains essential for exact solutions while AI methods offer competitive performance on smaller instances, with hybrid approaches presenting the most promising direction for scaling to larger problem sizes."}

In this work, we introduce the linear constraint-driven clipping framework, a class of scalable and efficient methods designed to enhance the efficacy of NN verifiers. Under this framework, we develop two novel algorithms that efficiently utilize linear constraints to 1) reduce portions of the input space that are either verified or irrelevant to a subproblem in the context of branch-and-bound, and 2) directly improve intermediate bounds throughout the network. The process novelly leverages linear constraints that often arise from bound propagation methods and is general enough to also incorporate constraints from other sources. It efficiently handles linear constraints using a specialized GPU procedure that can scale to large neural networks without the use of expensive external solvers. Our verification procedure, Clip-and-Verify, consistently tightens bounds across multiple benchmarks and can significantly reduce the number of subproblems handled during BaB. We show that our clipping algorithms can be integrated with BaB-based verifiers such as $α,β$-CROWN, utilizing either the split constraints in activation-space BaB or the output constraints that denote the unverified input space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our procedure on a broad range of benchmarks where, in some instances, we witness a 96% reduction in the number of subproblems during branch-and-bound, and also achieve state-of-the-art verified accuracy across multiple benchmarks.

For nine globally limiting pests, weeds, and plant diseases, we assessed the factual accuracy, data consistency, and breadth of knowledge or data completeness of each LLM. Overall, DeepSeek consistently screened a 4.8-49.7-fold larger literature corpus and reported 1.6-2.4-fold more biological control agents or management solutions than ChatGPT.

In this work, we present the first systematic study of PLL methods for ECG diagnosis. We adapt nine PLL algorithms to multi-label ECG diagnosis and evaluate them using a diverse set of clinically motivated ambiguity generation strategies, capturing both unstructured (e.g., random) and structured ambiguities (e.g., cardiologist-derived similarities, treatment relationships, and diagnostic taxonomies). Our experiments on the PTB-XL and Chapman datasets demonstrate that PLL methods vary substantially in their robustness to different types and degrees of ambiguity.

We also generated synthetic versions of each sample with carefully crafted prompts to preserve the original content while reflecting subgroup-specific writing styles. Using this, we evaluate four open-source state-of-the-art AI text detectors and find consistent disparities in detection performance, particularly low recall rates for texts from underrepresented groups.

Multi-objective Bayesian optimization is a promising solution for such expensive, black-box problems: it fits probabilistic surrogates and selects new designs via an acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation. In practice, it requires tailored choices of surrogate and acquisition that rarely transfer to the next problem, is myopic when multi-step planning is often required, and adds refitting overhead, particularly in parallel or time-sensitive loops. We present TAMO, a fully amortized, universal policy for multi-objective black-box optimization. TAMO uses a transformer architecture that operates across varying input and objective dimensions, enabling pretraining on diverse corpora and transfer to new problems without retraining: at test time, the pretrained model proposes the next design with a single forward pass. We pretrain the policy with reinforcement learning to maximize cumulative hypervolume improvement over full trajectories, conditioning on the entire query history to approximate the Pareto frontier. Across synthetic benchmarks and real tasks, TAMO produces fast proposals, reducing proposal time by 50-1000x versus alternatives while matching or improving Pareto quality under tight evaluation budgets. These results show that transformers can perform multi-objective optimization entirely in-context, eliminating per-task surrogate fitting and acquisition engineering, and open a path to foundation-style, plug-and-play optimizers for scientific discovery workflows."}

An evaluation system comprising twenty medical probes across five core dimensions was used to simulate a genuine clinical communication environment.

We present a novel two-stage learning framework that combines physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Continuous Flow Matching (CFM) for solving DC-OPF problems. Our approach embeds fundamental physical principles--including economic dispatch optimality conditions, Kirchhoff's laws, and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) complementarity conditions--directly into the training objectives. The first stage trains a GNN to produce feasible initial solutions by learning from physics-informed losses that encode power system constraints. The second stage employs CFM, a simulation-free continuous normalizing flow technique, to refine these solutions toward optimality through learned vector field regression.

In this paper, we study a new and challenging setting of fairness-regularized smoothed online convex optimization with switching costs. First, to highlight the fundamental challenges introduced by the long-term fairness regularizer evaluated based on the entire sequence of actions, we prove that even without switching costs, no online algorithms can possibly achieve a sublinear regret or finite competitive ratio compared to the offline optimal algorithm as the problem episode length $T$ increases. Then, we propose FairOBD (Fairness-regularized Online Balanced Descent), which reconciles the tension between minimizing the hitting cost, switching cost, and fairness cost. Concretely, FairOBD decomposes the long-term fairness cost into a sequence of online costs by introducing an auxiliary variable and then leverages the auxiliary variable to regularize the online actions for fair outcomes. Based on a new approach to account for switching costs, we prove that FairOBD offers a worst-case asymptotic competitive ratio against a novel benchmark -- the optimal offline algorithm with parameterized constraints -- by considering $T\\to\\infty$. Finally, we run trace-driven experiments of dynamic computing resource provisioning for socially responsible AI inference to empirically evaluate FairOBD, showing that FairOBD can effectively reduce the total fairness-regularized cost and better promote fair outcomes compared to existing baseline solutions."}

To tackle this challenge, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline that transforms noisy rollouts into reliable supervision without human annotation. The core idea is step-level filtering, which evaluates actions individually to retain only correct steps, complemented by reasoning augmentation for improved planning. Using this pipeline, we construct WebSTAR, a dataset of 13.3K trajectories and 100K graded, reasoning-rich steps synthesized from OpenAI's computer-use-preview model.

The proposed system jointly processes visual (facial expression), auditory (speech tone), and textual (comments or utterances) modalities through pretrained encoders ViT, Wav2Vec2, and BERT, followed by an attention-based fusion module to learn emotion-intent representations. These embeddings are then used to drive personalized content recommendations through a contextual matching layer. Experiments conducted on benchmark emotion datasets (AIGC-INT, MELD, and CMU-MOSEI) and an AIGC interaction dataset demonstrate that the proposed MMEI model achieves a 4.3% improvement in F1-score and a 12.3% reduction in cross-entropy loss compared to the best fusion-based transformer baseline. Furthermore, user-level online evaluations reveal that emotion-driven recommendations increase engagement time by 15.2% and enhance satisfaction scores by 11.8%, confirming the model's effectiveness in aligning AI-generated content with users' affective and intentional states. This work highlights the potential of cross-modal emotional intelligence for next-generation AIGC ecosystems, enabling adaptive, empathetic, and context-aware recommendation experiences."}

While recent methods excel at learning sparse coordination graphs-determining who communicates with whom-they do not address what information should be transmitted under hard bandwidth constraints. We study this bandwidth-limited regime and show that naive dimensionality reduction consistently degrades coordination performance. Hard bandwidth constraints force selective encoding, but deterministic projections lack mechanisms to control how compression occurs. We introduce Bandwidth-constrained Variational Message Encoding (BVME), a lightweight module that treats messages as samples from learned Gaussian posteriors regularized via KL divergence to an uninformative prior. BVME's variational framework provides principled, tunable control over compression strength through interpretable hyperparameters, directly constraining the representations used for decision-making. Across SMACv1, SMACv2, and MPE benchmarks, BVME achieves comparable or superior performance while using 67--83% fewer message dimensions, with gains most pronounced on sparse graphs where message quality critically impacts coordination. Ablations reveal U-shaped sensitivity to bandwidth, with BVME excelling at extreme ratios while adding minimal overhead."}

The natural progression has been toward larger, more comprehensive and challenging collections of static problems, an approach that inadvertently constrains the kinds of advances we can measure and incentivize. To address this limitation, we argue for progress-oriented benchmarks, problem environments whose objectives are themselves the core targets of scientific progress, so that achieving state of the art on the benchmark advances the field. As a introductory step, we instantiate an environment based on the NanoGPT speedrun. The environment standardizes a dataset slice, a reference model and training harness, and rich telemetry, with run-time verification and anti-gaming checks. Evaluation centers on the scientific delta achieved: best-attained loss and the efficiency frontier. Using this environment, we achieve a new state-of-the-art training time, improving upon the previous record by 3 seconds, and qualitatively observe the emergence of novel algorithmic ideas. Moreover, comparisons between models and agents remain possible, but they are a means, not the end; the benchmark's purpose is to catalyze reusable improvements to the language modeling stack. With this release, the overarching goal is to seed a community shift from static problem leaderboards to test-time research on open-ended yet measurable scientific problems. In this new paradigm, progress on the benchmark is progress on the science, thus reframing \"benchmarking\" as a vehicle for scientific advancement."}

This architecture enables modular integration of new modalities (e.g., audio features via emotion2vec), seamless replacement of outdated components, and reduced computational overhead during training. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through a proof-of-concept implementation supporting vision, audio, and text modalities, with the classifier serving as a shared decision-making agent.

Like any machine learning problem, the choice of activation function influences the characteristics and performance of the solution obtained from physics-informed training. Several studies have compared common activation functions on benchmark differential equations, and have unanimously found that the rectified linear unit (ReLU) is outperformed by competitors such as the sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, and swish activation functions. In this work, we diagnose the poor performance of ReLU on physics-informed machine learning problems. While it is well-known that the piecewise linear form of ReLU prevents it from being used on second-order differential equations, we show that ReLU fails even on variational problems involving only first derivatives. We identify the cause of this failure as second derivatives of the activation, which are taken not in the formulation of the loss, but in the process of training. Namely, we show that automatic differentiation in PyTorch fails to characterize derivatives of discontinuous fields, which causes the gradient of the physics-informed loss to be mis-specified, thus explaining the poor performance of ReLU."}

While prior efforts leverage 1D representations like SELFIES to ensure molecular validity, they fail to fully exploit the rich chemical knowledge entangled within 1D models, leading to a disconnect between 1D syntactic generation and 3D geometric realization. To bridge this gap, we propose MolSculpt, a novel framework that \"sculpts\" 3D molecular geometries from chemical syntax. MolSculpt is built upon a frozen 1D molecular foundation model and a 3D molecular diffusion model. We introduce a set of learnable queries to extract inherent chemical knowledge from the foundation model, and a trainable projector then injects this cross-modal information into the conditioning space of the diffusion model to guide the 3D geometry generation. In this way, our model deeply integrates 1D latent chemical knowledge into the 3D generation process through end-to-end optimization. Experiments demonstrate that MolSculpt achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in \\textit{de novo} 3D molecule generation and conditional 3D molecule generation, showing superior 3D fidelity and stability on both the GEOM-DRUGS and QM9 datasets.

While conventional dememorization techniques, such as regularization and data filtering, limit overfitting to specific training examples, they fail to systematically prevent the internalization of prohibited concept-level features. Simply discarding all images containing a sensitive feature wastes invaluable training data, necessitating a method for selective unlearning at the concept level.\n  To address this, we introduce a Gradient Projection Framework designed to enforce a stringent requirement of concept-level feature exclusion. Our defense operates during backpropagation by systematically identifying and excising training signals aligned with embeddings of prohibited attributes. Specifically, we project each gradient update onto the orthogonal complement of the sensitive feature's embedding space, thereby zeroing out its influence on the model's weights. Our method integrates seamlessly into standard diffusion model training pipelines and complements existing defenses. We analyze our method against an adversary aiming for feature extraction. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework drastically reduces memorization while rigorously preserving generation quality and semantic fidelity. By reframing memorization control as selective learning, our approach establishes a new paradigm for IP-safe and privacy-preserving generative AI."}

In this work, we introduce the linear constraint-driven clipping framework, a class of scalable and efficient methods designed to enhance the efficacy of NN verifiers. Under this framework, we develop two novel algorithms that efficiently utilize linear constraints to 1) reduce portions of the input space that are either verified or irrelevant to a subproblem in the context of branch-and-bound, and 2) directly improve intermediate bounds throughout the network. The process novelly leverages linear constraints that often arise from bound propagation methods and is general enough to also incorporate constraints from other sources. It efficiently handles linear constraints using a specialized GPU procedure that can scale to large neural networks without the use of expensive external solvers. Our verification procedure, Clip-and-Verify, consistently tightens bounds across multiple benchmarks and can significantly reduce the number of subproblems handled during BaB. We show that our clipping algorithms can be integrated with BaB-based verifiers such as $α,β$-CROWN, utilizing either the split constraints in activation-space BaB or the output constraints that denote the unverified input space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our procedure on a broad range of benchmarks where, in some instances, we witness a 96% reduction in the number of subproblems during branch-and-bound, and also achieve state-of-the-art verified accuracy across multiple benchmarks.

Multi-objective Bayesian optimization is a promising solution for such expensive, black-box problems: it fits probabilistic surrogates and selects new designs via an acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation. In practice, it requires tailored choices of surrogate and acquisition that rarely transfer to the next problem, is myopic when multi-step planning is often required, and adds refitting overhead, particularly in parallel or time-sensitive loops. We present TAMO, a fully amortized, universal policy for multi-objective black-box optimization. TAMO uses a transformer architecture that operates across varying input and objective dimensions, enabling pretraining on diverse corpora and transfer to new problems without retraining: at test time, the pretrained model proposes the next design with a single forward pass. We pretrain the policy with reinforcement learning to maximize cumulative hypervolume improvement over full trajectories, conditioning on the entire query history to approximate the Pareto frontier. Across synthetic benchmarks and real tasks, TAMO produces fast proposals, reducing proposal time by 50-1000x versus alternatives while matching or improving Pareto quality under tight evaluation budgets. These results show that transformers can perform multi-objective optimization entirely in-context, eliminating per-task surrogate fitting and acquisition engineering, and open a path to foundation-style, plug-and-play optimizers for scientific discovery workflows."}

We show that although selection can significantly complicate the joint distribution, interestingly, the ranks in the biased covariance matrices still preserve meaningful information about both causal structures and selection mechanisms.

In this paper, we study a new and challenging setting of fairness-regularized smoothed online convex optimization with switching costs. First, to highlight the fundamental challenges introduced by the long-term fairness regularizer evaluated based on the entire sequence of actions, we prove that even without switching costs, no online algorithms can possibly achieve a sublinear regret or finite competitive ratio compared to the offline optimal algorithm as the problem episode length $T$ increases. Then, we propose FairOBD (Fairness-regularized Online Balanced Descent), which reconciles the tension between minimizing the hitting cost, switching cost, and fairness cost. Concretely, FairOBD decomposes the long-term fairness cost into a sequence of online costs by introducing an auxiliary variable and then leverages the auxiliary variable to regularize the online actions for fair outcomes. Based on a new approach to account for switching costs, we prove that FairOBD offers a worst-case asymptotic competitive ratio against a novel benchmark -- the optimal offline algorithm with parameterized constraints -- by considering $T\\to\\infty$. Finally, we run trace-driven experiments of dynamic computing resource provisioning for socially responsible AI inference to empirically evaluate FairOBD, showing that FairOBD can effectively reduce the total fairness-regularized cost and better promote fair outcomes compared to existing baseline solutions."}

Their potential exposure to external world makes them susceptible to cyber-attacks. Existing detection methods against controller logic attacks use either specification-based or learnt models. However, specification-based models require experts' manual efforts or access to PLC's source code, while machine learning-based models often fall short of providing explanation for their decisions. We design SRLR -- a it Symbolic Regression based Logic Recovery} solution to identify the logic of a PLC based only on its inputs and outputs. The recovered logic is used to generate explainable rules for detecting controller logic attacks. SRLR enhances the latest deep symbolic regression methods using the following ICS-specific properties: (1) some important ICS control logic is best represented in frequency domain rather than time domain; (2) an ICS controller can operate in multiple modes, each using different logic, where mode switches usually do not happen frequently; (3) a robust controller usually filters out outlier inputs as ICS sensor data can be noisy; and (4) with the above factors captured, the degree of complexity of the formulas is reduced, making effective search possible. Thanks to these enhancements, SRLR consistently outperforms all existing methods in a variety of ICS settings that we evaluate. In terms of the recovery accuracy, SRLR's gain can be as high as 39% in some challenging environment. We also evaluate SRLR on a distribution grid containing hundreds of voltage regulators, demonstrating its stability in handling large-scale, complex systems with varied configurations."}

Here, we propose Quantum Golay code Error Correction (QGEC), a QEC method using Golay code, which is an efficient coding method in classical information theory. We investigated our method's ability in decoding calculations with the Transformer. We evaluated the accuracy of the decoder in a code space defined by the generative polynomials with three different weights sets and three noise models with different correlations of bit-flip error and phase-flip error. Furthermore, under a noise model following a discrete uniform distribution, we compared the decoding performance of Transformer decoders with identical architectures trained respectively on Golay and toric codes. The results showed that the noise model with the smaller correlation gave better accuracy, while the weights of the generative polynomials had little effect on the accuracy of the decoder. In addition, they showed that Golay code requiring 23 data qubits and having a code distance of 7 achieved higher decoding accuracy than toric code which requiring 50 data qubits and having a code distance of 5. This suggests that implementing quantum error correction using a Transformer may enable the Golay code to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation more efficiently."}

However, raw sensor streams are often imbalanced and contain significant redundancy, meaning that not all data points contribute equally to model generalization. In this paper, we show that, in some cases, \"less is more\" when considering datasets. We do this by reframing the data selection problem: rather than tuning model hyperparameters, we fix the model and optimize the composition of the training data itself. We introduce a framework for discovering the optimal \"training diet\" from a large, unlabeled time series corpus. Our framework first uses a large-scale encoder and k-means clustering to partition the dataset into distinct, behaviorally consistent clusters. These clusters represent the fundamental 'ingredients' available for training. We then employ the Optuna optimization framework to search the high-dimensional space of possible data mixtures. For each trial, Optuna proposes a specific sampling ratio for each cluster, and a new training set is constructed based on this recipe. A smaller target model is then trained and evaluated. Our experiments reveal that this data-centric search consistently discovers data mixtures that yield models with significantly higher performance compared to baselines trained on the entire dataset. Specifically - evaluated on PMSM dataset - our method improved performance from a baseline MSE of 1.70 to 1.37, a 19.41% improvement."}

Although purely data-driven models demonstrate strong fitting performance, their interpretability and cross-distribution generalization capabilities remain limited.

While steering these policies with reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising mechanism for fine-tuning beyond demonstration data, directly applying standard (non-equivariant) RL can be sample-inefficient and unstable, as it ignores the symmetries that EDPs are designed to exploit. In this paper, we theoretically establish that the diffusion process of an EDP is equivariant, which in turn induces a group-invariant latent-noise MDP that is well-suited for equivariant diffusion steering. Building on this theory, we introduce a principled symmetry-aware steering framework and compare standard, equivariant, and approximately equivariant RL strategies through comprehensive experiments across tasks with varying degrees of symmetry. While we identify the practical boundaries of strict equivariance under symmetry breaking, we show that exploiting symmetry during the steering process yields substantial benefits-enhancing sample efficiency, preventing value divergence, and achieving strong policy improvements even when EDPs are trained from extremely limited demonstrations."}

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for trust prediction, owing to their ability to learn expressive node representations that capture intricate trust relationships within a network. However, current GNN-based trust prediction models face several limitations: (i) Most of them fail to capture trust dynamicity, leading to questionable inferences. (ii) They rarely consider the heterogeneous nature of real-world networks, resulting in a loss of rich semantics. (iii) None of them support context-awareness, a basic property of trust, making prediction results coarse-grained.\n  To this end, we propose CAT, the first Context-Aware GNN-based Trust prediction model that supports trust dynamicity and accurately represents real-world heterogeneity. CAT consists of a graph construction layer, an embedding layer, a heterogeneous attention layer, and a prediction layer. It handles dynamic graphs using continuous-time representations and captures temporal information through a time encoding function. To model graph heterogeneity and leverage semantic information, CAT employs a dual attention mechanism that identifies the importance of different node types and nodes within each type. For context-awareness, we introduce a new notion of meta-paths to extract contextual features. By constructing context embeddings and integrating a context-aware aggregator, CAT can predict both context-aware trust and overall trust. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CAT outperforms five groups of baselines in trust prediction, while exhibiting strong scalability to large-scale graphs and robustness against both trust-oriented and GNN-oriented attacks."}

We propose novel attack and defense techniques for community detection problem, with the objective of hiding targeted individuals from detection models and enhancing the robustness of community detection models, respectively. These techniques have many applications in real-world scenarios, for example, protecting personal privacy in social networks and understanding camouflage patterns in transaction networks. To simulate interactive attack and defense behaviors, we further propose a game-theoretic framework, called CD-GAME. One player is a graph attacker, while the other player is a Rayleigh Quotient defender. The CD-GAME models the mutual influence and feedback mechanisms between the attacker and the defender, revealing the dynamic evolutionary process of the game. Both players dynamically update their strategies until they reach the Nash equilibrium. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack and defense methods, and both outperform existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, CD-GAME provides valuable insights for understanding interactive attack and defense scenarios in community detection problems. We found that in traditional single-step attack or defense, attacker tends to employ strategies that are most effective, but are easily detected and countered by defender. When the interactive game reaches a Nash equilibrium, attacker adopts more imperceptible strategies that can still achieve satisfactory attack effectiveness even after defense."}

To address this issue, we introduce Null-Space constrained Policy Optimization (NSPO), a novel RL framework for LLM safety alignment while preserving their core abilities. The safety policy gradients are geometrically projected into the null space of general tasks, thereby mitigating the safety alignment tax. In addition, we theoretically prove that NSPO preserves the model's original core capabilities, while still guaranteeing a descent direction for effective safety alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSPO outperforms existing methods by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art safety performance without sacrificing accuracy on general tasks, including math, code, and instruction-following tasks.

In real-world settings, some anomalous events have lasting effects and influence the forecast, while others are short-lived and should be ignored. Standard forecasting models fail to make this distinction, often either overreacting to noise or missing persistent shifts. We propose Co-TSFA (Contrastive Time Series Forecasting with Anomalies), a regularization framework that learns when to ignore anomalies and when to respond. Co-TSFA generates input-only and input-output augmentations to model forecast-irrelevant and forecast-relevant anomalies, and introduces a latent-output alignment loss that ties representation changes to forecast changes. This encourages invariance to irrelevant perturbations while preserving sensitivity to meaningful distributional shifts. Experiments on the Traffic and Electricity benchmarks, as well as on a real-world cash-demand dataset, demonstrate that Co-TSFA improves performance under anomalous conditions while maintaining accuracy on normal data.

In addition, since the beam search involves a vast item space, the sorting overhead becomes particularly time-consuming. We propose xGR, a GR-oriented serving system that meets strict low-latency requirements under highconcurrency scenarios. First, xGR unifies the processing of prefill and decode phases through staged computation and separated KV cache.

However, raw sensor streams are often imbalanced and contain significant redundancy, meaning that not all data points contribute equally to model generalization. In this paper, we show that, in some cases, \"less is more\" when considering datasets. We do this by reframing the data selection problem: rather than tuning model hyperparameters, we fix the model and optimize the composition of the training data itself. We introduce a framework for discovering the optimal \"training diet\" from a large, unlabeled time series corpus. Our framework first uses a large-scale encoder and k-means clustering to partition the dataset into distinct, behaviorally consistent clusters. These clusters represent the fundamental 'ingredients' available for training. We then employ the Optuna optimization framework to search the high-dimensional space of possible data mixtures. For each trial, Optuna proposes a specific sampling ratio for each cluster, and a new training set is constructed based on this recipe. A smaller target model is then trained and evaluated. Our experiments reveal that this data-centric search consistently discovers data mixtures that yield models with significantly higher performance compared to baselines trained on the entire dataset. Specifically - evaluated on PMSM dataset - our method improved performance from a baseline MSE of 1.70 to 1.37, a 19.41% improvement."}

MKL seeks an optimal linear combination of base kernels that maximizes a generalized performance measure under a regularization constraint. Various norms have been used to regularize the kernel weights, including $l1$, $l2$ and $lp$, as well as the \"elastic-net\" penalty, which combines $l1$- and $l2$-norm to promote both sparsity and the selection of correlated kernels. This property makes elastic-net regularized MKL (ENMKL) especially valuable when model interpretability is critical and kernels capture correlated information, such as in neuroimaging. Previous ENMKL methods have followed a two-stage procedure: fix kernel weights, train a support vector machine (SVM) with the weighted kernel, and then update the weights via gradient descent, cutting-plane methods, or surrogate functions. Here, we introduce an alternative ENMKL formulation that yields a simple analytical update for the kernel weights. We derive explicit algorithms for both SVM and kernel ridge regression (KRR) under this framework, and implement them in the open-source Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox (PRoNTo). We evaluate these ENMKL algorithms against $l1$-norm MKL and against SVM (or KRR) trained on the unweighted sum of kernels across three neuroimaging applications. Our results show that ENMKL matches or outperforms $l1$-norm MKL in all tasks and only underperforms standard SVM in one scenario. Crucially, ENMKL produces sparser, more interpretable models by selectively weighting correlated kernels."}

In this work, we introduce the view space, a novel representational axis in which arbitrary graphs can be naturally encoded in a unified manner. We then propose Graph View Transformation (GVT), a node- and feature-permutation-equivariant mapping in the view space. GVT serves as the building block for Recurrent GVT, a fully inductive model for node representation learning. Pretrained on OGBN-Arxiv and evaluated on 27 node-classification benchmarks, Recurrent GVT outperforms GraphAny, the prior fully inductive graph model, by +8.93% and surpasses 12 individually tuned GNNs by at least +3.30%.

We introduce Brain-Semantoks, a self-supervised framework designed specifically to learn abstract representations of brain dynamics. Its architecture is built on two core innovations: a semantic tokenizer that aggregates noisy regional signals into robust tokens representing functional networks, and a self-distillation objective that enforces representational stability across time. We show that this objective is stabilized through a novel training curriculum, ensuring the model robustly learns meaningful features from low signal-to-noise time series. We demonstrate that learned representations enable strong performance on a variety of downstream tasks even when only using a linear probe. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive scaling analyses indicating more unlabeled data reliably results in out-of-distribution performance gains without domain adaptation."}

This reduction yields significantly simpler algorithmic steps, which we analyze using classical linear algebra tools. Using these tools, we demonstrate on a minimalistic example that the nonlinearity in a two-layer model can provably yield a faster iteration complexity $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{d})$ compared to $Ω(d)$ achieved by linear models, where $d$ is the number of features. This helps explain the optimization dynamics and the implicit acceleration phenomenon observed in neural networks. The theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical experiments.

However, existing research communities address these challenges in isolation. Continual Learning (CL) focuses on long-term retention and mitigating catastrophic forgetting, often without strict real-time constraints. Stream Learning (SL) emphasizes rapid, efficient adaptation to high-frequency data streams, but typically neglects forgetting. Recent efforts have tried to combine these paradigms, yet no clear algorithmic overlap exists. We argue that large in-context tabular models (LTMs) provide a natural bridge for Streaming Continual Learning (SCL). In our view, unbounded streams should be summarized on-the-fly into compact sketches that can be consumed by LTMs. This recovers the classical SL motivation of compressing massive streams with fixed-size guarantees, while simultaneously aligning with the experience-replay desiderata of CL. To clarify this bridge, we show how the SL and CL communities implicitly adopt a divide-to-conquer strategy to manage the tension between plasticity (performing well on the current distribution) and stability (retaining past knowledge), while also imposing a minimal complexity constraint that motivates diversification (avoiding redundancy in what is stored) and retrieval (re-prioritizing past information when needed). Within this perspective, we propose structuring SCL with LTMs around two core principles of data selection for in-context learning: (1) distribution matching, which balances plasticity and stability, and (2) distribution compression, which controls memory size through diversification and retrieval mechanisms."}

Bayesian optimization, a widely used black-box and sample-efficient learning method, constructs a probabilistic surrogate of the closed-loop performance from few experiments and uses it to select informative controller parameters. However, it typically struggles with dense high-dimensional controller parameterizations, as they may appear, for example, in tuning model predictive controllers, because standard surrogate models fail to capture the structure of such spaces. This work suggests that the use of Bayesian neural networks as surrogate models may help to mitigate this limitation. Through a comparison between Gaussian processes with Matern kernels, finite-width Bayesian neural networks, and infinite-width Bayesian neural networks on a cart-pole task, we find that Bayesian neural network surrogate models achieve faster and more reliable convergence of the closed-loop cost and enable successful optimization of parameterizations with hundreds of dimensions. Infinite-width Bayesian neural networks also maintain performance in settings with more than one thousand parameters, whereas Matern-kernel Gaussian processes rapidly lose effectiveness. These results indicate that Bayesian neural network surrogate models may be suitable for learning dense high-dimensional controller parameterizations and offer practical guidance for selecting surrogate models in learning-based controller design."}

While robust aggregation methods (including Krum, Bulyan, and coordinate-wise defenses) offer theoretical guarantees under idealized assumptions, their effectiveness erodes substantially when client data distributions are heterogeneous (non-IID) and adversaries can observe or approximate the defense mechanism.\n  This paper introduces SpectralKrum, a defense that fuses spectral subspace estimation with geometric neighbor-based selection. The core insight is that benign optimization trajectories, despite per-client heterogeneity, concentrate near a low-dimensional manifold that can be estimated from historical aggregates. SpectralKrum projects incoming updates into this learned subspace, applies Krum selection in compressed coordinates, and filters candidates whose orthogonal residual energy exceeds a data-driven threshold. The method requires no auxiliary data, operates entirely on model updates, and preserves FL privacy properties.\n  We evaluate SpectralKrum against eight robust baselines across seven attack scenarios on CIFAR-10 with Dirichlet-distributed non-IID partitions (alpha = 0.1). Experiments spanning over 56,000 training rounds show that SpectralKrum is competitive against directional and subspace-aware attacks (adaptive-steer, buffer-drift), but offers limited advantage under label-flip and min-max attacks where malicious updates remain spectrally indistinguishable from benign ones."}

AVC decouples manifold learning from function approximation by using a deep network to learn a diffeomorphic warping of the physical domain, projecting complex spatiotemporal dynamics onto a latent manifold where the solution is represented by a basis of generalized analytic functions.

Building on this insight, we establish non-asymptotic concentration bounds for the output and gradient of softmax attention, quantifying how rapidly the finite-prompt model approaches its infinite-prompt counterpart, and prove that this concentration remains stable along the entire training trajectory in general in-context learning settings with sub-Gaussian tokens. In the case of in-context linear regression, we use the tractable infinite-prompt dynamics to analyze training at finite prompt length. Our results allow optimization analyses developed for linear attention to transfer directly to softmax attention when prompts are sufficiently long, showing that large-prompt softmax attention inherits the analytical structure of its linear counterpart. This, in turn, provides a principled and broadly applicable toolkit for studying the training dynamics and statistical behavior of softmax attention layers in large prompt regimes."}

We present a simple geometric method for discovering interactions and redundancies: when elements are added in random sequential orders and their contributions plotted over many trials, characteristic L-shaped patterns emerge that directly reflect interaction structure. The approach quantifies how the contribution of each element depends on those added before it, revealing patterns that distinguish interaction, independence, and redundancy on a unified scale. When pairwise contributions are visualized as two--dimensional point clouds, redundant pairs form L--shaped patterns where only the first-added element contributes, while synergistic pairs form L--shaped patterns where only elements contribute together. Independent elements show order--invariant distributions. We formalize this with the L--score, a continuous measure ranging from $-1$ (perfect synergy, e.g. $Y=X_1X_2$) to $0$ (independence) to $+1$ (perfect redundancy, $X_1 \\approx X_2$). The relative scaling of the L--shaped arms reveals feature dominance in which element consistently provides more information. Although computed only from pairwise measurements, higher--order interactions among three or more elements emerge naturally through consistent cross--pair relationships (e.g. AB, AC, BC).

To address this limitation, this study proposes a Multi-Modal Emotion and Intent Recognition Model (MMEI) based on a BERT-based Cross-Modal Transformer with Attention-Based Fusion, integrated into a cloud-native personalized AIGC recommendation framework. The proposed system jointly processes visual (facial expression), auditory (speech tone), and textual (comments or utterances) modalities through pretrained encoders ViT, Wav2Vec2, and BERT, followed by an attention-based fusion module to learn emotion-intent representations. These embeddings are then used to drive personalized content recommendations through a contextual matching layer. Experiments conducted on benchmark emotion datasets (AIGC-INT, MELD, and CMU-MOSEI) and an AIGC interaction dataset demonstrate that the proposed MMEI model achieves a 4.3% improvement in F1-score and a 12.3% reduction in cross-entropy loss compared to the best fusion-based transformer baseline. Furthermore, user-level online evaluations reveal that emotion-driven recommendations increase engagement time by 15.2% and enhance satisfaction scores by 11.8%, confirming the model's effectiveness in aligning AI-generated content with users' affective and intentional states.

TxAgent employs a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model that dynamically generates and executes function calls to a unified biomedical tool suite (ToolUniverse), integrating FDA Drug API, OpenTargets, and Monarch resources to ensure access to current therapeutic information. In contrast to general-purpose RAG systems, medical applications impose stringent safety constraints, rendering the accuracy of both the reasoning trace and the sequence of tool invocations critical. These considerations motivate evaluation protocols treating token-level reasoning and tool-usage behaviors as explicit supervision signals. This work presents insights derived from our participation in the CURE-Bench NeurIPS 2025 Challenge, which benchmarks therapeutic-reasoning systems using metrics that assess correctness, tool utilization, and reasoning quality. We analyze how retrieval quality for function (tool) calls influences overall model performance and demonstrate performance gains achieved through improved tool-retrieval strategies.
